*Where I left off with my copilot(s)*

- The category pages are broken, but I don't think I need them
- I want to now:
  - Add the text content to tag pages (i.e. tags/cognitive-frames/)
  - Remove those pages (i.e. product-management/_index.md)
- To decide 🤔
  - Fix broken links: I like the folder structure that tells me the theme it relates to. It makes it easy to see where I should fill in gaps in my thinking. However, it introduces broken links (i.e. garden/philosophy-psychology/sensitive-alternatives-to/ was originally garden/sensitive-alternatives-to/)
  - I want to map this folder structure to my Obsidian/Enveloppe workflow so I can organize it in Obsidian this way as well.
