I'm trying out extending my [website](https://mbbroberg.fun) with a digital garden, which feels more aligned to my increasing preference for [horizontal organic growth](../../../content/garden/Concepts/Rhizomes.md) rather than tree-centric metaphors.

The site name is a play off "lossy" [Mental Models](On%20Mental%20Models.md), which I am sure to reflect in my thoughts here.

## Take a look around

This space is how I organize my daily [personal knowledge management](My%20path%20to%20Personal%20Knowledge%20Management%20(PKM).md). I also have an evolving tagging strategy that [plays off the nature theme](Build%20a%20Digital%20Garden%20from%20Obsidian.md).
