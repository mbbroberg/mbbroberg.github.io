[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/61fb1a92-2df6-451f-96c6-509f29ca23b5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sleepy-meninsky-593e27/deploys)

A reasonably simple site extended from [this Jekyll theme](http://sergiokopplin.github.io/indigo/). If you'd like to extend your own, I recommend starting with the original theme. There be dragons here 🐉.

## Notes to self 📝

- Keep the theme updated wih `git submodule update --remote --merge`
