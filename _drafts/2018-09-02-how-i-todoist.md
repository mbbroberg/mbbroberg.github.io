description: Todoist is the single most helpful productivity tool I use. 
---

Todoist is a freemium application I have consistently used for a few years now. Before that, I had been switching between an endless supply of options. But before we get into the tool, there's a more important question of the routine.

## My productivity practice

Before I found my flow, I spent everyday looking at tasks with a sense of wide-eyed overwhelm. What will I tackle next? A "quick win" or do I "swallow the toad" by starting with something challenging? Most importantly, I never felt confident saying "no" to a request, because I couldn't quite say what I was going to work on instead and I didn't know when I could potentially help them.

It all started to make sense when I found a framework that helped me effectively limit my work. That's made up of a practice more than a software system, which seems to make all the difference. No todo task manager will help you define how you spend your time. It will, at best, offer a way to manage the work gracefully.  

1-3-5 strategy 

### My productivity routine



Here's the workflow that got me to keep it:

## Tasks

And what isnt. 

### Task tips

I think about how I frame my tasks, especially keeping in mind these tricks:

- **Keep each task actionable.** For instance, changing "Hear back from Mary" to "Check for an email from Mary."
- **Repeat tasks until their done.** Outstanding tasks may take a while when they depend on others, but we should still get our daily dopamine for checking the box. Use the syntax `repeat daily` or `repeat workday` to keep track of it every day or just during the work week.
- Severely limit auto-generation of tasks. I'm opposed to this entirely and I think it should be used sparingly. Part of GTD, in my opinion is that the collection and processing of tasks is part of the work itself. It allows your brain to assess the task, decide it's current priority, future value, etc. When you start to outsource the process to automation, you lose the ability to manage your own system and you wind up where you are now. I've seen it many times.

This slightly-cheesy-but-thoughtful [post from the creators of Todoist](https://blog.doist.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-your-todoist-8413b3e06473) changed my philosophy on how to write a useful task. It's worth a read as well.

## Projects

I've gone back and forth on dozens of projects to keep everything "organized" (air quote the hell out of that as you read it) and going minimalist with the inbox to keep it "simple" (same air quotes apply). I think the benefits and goal is up to you. My layout these days is: 

- Projects
- Responsibilities
- Routines
- Work
- For Me

Each one of these has a different color and 2-5 sub-projects that are specific to something important to me. For instance, I like to see how much of my work is related to each of my major work efforts, so it's sub-projects are:

- **Community** for tasks related to building community
- **Admin** for overhead tasks like actually scheduling a meeting or completing expenses
- **Writing** for my writing assignments

### Project tips 


- **Separate habit tracking from productivity and task management.** Your list will get crowded if you have all your "be a better person" type tasks alongside your productivity tasks on a daily basis. Separate these into different Projects, and ultimately use a filter to see only important work.

## Prioritizing 


Another helpful functionality of Todoist involves prioritization, which you can easily add to a task with a `P` and a number between 1-4. It took me a while to know what these priorities meant to me. I eventually fully stole from my friend Christian [over at vNinja](https://vninja.net/workflow/how-i-use-todoist/):

Okay, that's not the whole story. I don't use Priorities like this. I mostly use tags to signify what I'm working on.

## Tags

All about the 1-3-5 method. 

* Ps mean urgency. 
    * The higher the P, the sooner I should schedule it for completion.
* @s mean energy.
    * The higher the @, the closer to my pique hours I should schedule it, and the fewer distractions are allowed.

## Filters

Powerful advice from another [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/todoist/comments/a4vn2i/automatically_reschedule_overdue_to_today/). 

> 1. Todoist is made for people that actually use their to do list! Daily! We don't let the day end without checking if every task is done or at least handled in some way. One does not simply walk into Mordor without checking Todoist! Some of use even have a recurring task that reminds them every evening to process their inbox and their remaining tasks. Some of us have the Todoist widget on their home screen (Android). Also, we open Todoist every morning anyways. ðŸ˜ƒ
> 2. We try not to schedule tasks for today if it is not necessary to complete the task today - so we don't have to postpone it in the first place. Many have a custom filtered view that in addition to today's tasks also shows tasks that could be completed soon. Like: Today | @soon or @focus & no date, Today
> 3. If you'd automatically reschedule all overdue tasks, then why schedule them? You don't have to schedule at all! Instead you could just use Priority1 for your "kinda-today" tasks and again use a filtered view. You could see the priorities as P1=now, P2=today-ish, P3=soon, p4=someday/maybe. Then set up your custom today view with filter: P1, P2, P3 And instead of re-scheduling daily you just re-prioritize every couple of days.
> 4. Remember, you can still set reminders for tasks that aren't scheduled! You can even set a recurring reminder to remind you every day of those open P1 tasks until you complete them.

## Calendar synchronization

Essential part of the process for me. 

## What the flow feels like 

I know my system is working when I exhibit the following behavior: 

- I see a limited amount of work to get done on a given day that reflects my calendar and my priorities. 
- If there's a task I want to complete right now, but it's not a priority or as urgent as I'm thinking it feels, I instead **schedule time on the calendar to complete the task**. That extra step helps me stay on (the right) task.
- All work that I would like to get done today has time blocked on the calendar to complete it.
