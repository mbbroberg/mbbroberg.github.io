description: Todoist is the single most helpful productivity tool I use.

Todoist is a freemium application I have consistently used for a few years now. Before that, I had been switching between an endless supply of options. But before we get into the tool, there's a more important question of the routine.

## My productivity routine

Before I found my flow, I spent everyday looking at tasks with a sense of wide-eyed overwhelm. What will I tackle next? A "quick win" or do I "swallow the toad" by starting with something challenging? Most importantly, I never felt confident saying "no" to a request, because I couldn't quite say what I was going to work on instead and I didn't know when I could potentially help them. 

It all started to make sense when I found a framework that helped me effectively limit my work. 



Here's the workflow that got me to keep it:

## Tasks

And what isnt. 

### Task tips

I think about how I frame my tasks, especially keeping in mind these tricks:

- **Keep each task actionable.** For instance, changing "Hear back from Mary" to "Check for an email from Mary."
- **Repeat tasks until their done.** Outstanding tasks may take a while when they depend on others, but we should still get our daily dopamine for checking the box. Use the syntax `repeat daily` or `repeat workday` to keep track of it every day or just during the work week.
- 

This slightly-cheesy-but-thoughtful [post from the creators of Todoist](https://blog.doist.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-your-todoist-8413b3e06473) changed my philosophy on how to write a useful task. It's worth a read as well.

## Projects

I've gone back and forth on dozens of projects to keep everything "organized" (air quote the hell out of that as you read it) and going minimalist with the inbox to keep it "simple" (same air quotes apply). I think the benefits and goal is up to you. My layout these days is: 

- Projects
- Responsibilities
- Routines
- Work
- For Me

Each one of these has a different color and 2-5 sub-projects that are specific to something important to me. For instance, I like to see how much of my work is related to each of my major work efforts, so it's sub-projects are:

- **Community** for tasks related to building community
- **Admin** for overhead tasks like actually scheduling a meeting or completing expenses
- **Writing** for my writing assignments

## Prioritizing 


Another helpful functionality of Todoist involves prioritization, which you can easily add to a task with a `P` and a number between 1-4. It took me a while to know what these priorities meant to me. I eventually fully stole from my friend Christian [over at vNinja](https://vninja.net/workflow/how-i-use-todoist/):

Okay, that's not the whole story. I don't use Priorities like this. I mostly use tags to signify what I'm working on.

## Tags

All about the 1-3-5 method. 

* Ps mean urgency. 
    * The higher the P, the sooner I should schedule it for completion.
* @s mean energy.
    * The higher the @, the closer to my pique hours I should schedule it, and the fewer distractions are allowed.

## Filters

## Calendar synchronization

Essential part of the process for me. 

## What the flow feels like 

I know my system is working when I exhibit the following behavior: 

- I see a limited amount of work to get done on a given day that reflects my calendar and my priorities. 
- If there's a task I want to complete right now, but it's not a priority or as urgent as I'm thinking it feels, I instead **schedule time on the calendar to complete the task**. That extra step helps me stay on (the right) task.
- All work that I would like to get done today has time blocked on the calendar to complete it.
