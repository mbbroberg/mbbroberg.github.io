description: Todoist is the single most helpful productivity tool I use.

Todoist is a freemium application I have consistently used for a few years now. Before that, I had been switching between an endless supply of options. But before we get into the tool, there's a more important question of the routine.

## My productivity routine

Before I found my flow, I spent everyday looking at tasks with a sense of wide-eyed overwhelm. What will I tackle next? A "quick win" or do I "swallow the toad" by starting with something challenging? Most importantly, I never felt confident saying "no" to a request, because I couldn't quite say what I was going to work on instead and I didn't know when I could potentially help them. 

It all started to make sense when I found a framework that helped me effectively limit my work. 



Here's the workflow that got me to keep it:

## Tasks

And what isnt. 

### Task tips

I think about how I frame my tasks, especially keeping in mind these tricks:

- **Keep each task actionable.** For instance, changing "Hear back from Mary" to "Check for an email from Mary."
- **Repeat tasks until their done.** Outstanding tasks may take a while when they depend on others, but we should still get our daily dopamine for checking the box. Use the syntax `repeat daily` or `repeat workday` to keep track of it every day or just during the work week.
- 

This slightly-cheesy-but-thoughtful [post from the creators of Todoist](https://blog.doist.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-your-todoist-8413b3e06473) changed my philosophy on how to write a useful task. It's worth a read as well.

## Projects

I've gone back and forth on dozens of projects to keep everything "organized" (air quote the hell out of that as you read it) and going minimalist with the inbox to keep it "simple" (same air quotes apply). I think the benefits and goal is up to you. My layout these days is: 

- Projects
- Responsibilities
- Routines
- Work
- For Me

Each one of these has a different color and 2-5 sub-projects that are specific to something important to me. For instance, I like to see how much of my work is related to each of my major work efforts, so it's sub-projects are:

- **Community** for tasks related to building community
- **Admin** for overhead tasks like actually scheduling a meeting or completing expenses
- **Writing** for my writing assignments

## Priorities

Another helpful functionality of Todoist involves prioritization, which you can easily add to a task with a `P` and a number between 1-4. It took me a while to know what these priorities meant to me. I eventually fully stole from my friend Christian [over at vNinja](https://vninja.net/workflow/how-i-use-todoist/):

- P1 — Important and urgent. Do these now.
- P2 — Important but not urgent. Must have a due date. Move to P1 on or before due date.
- P3 — Not important but urgent. Delegate to others, or change priority to P2 or P4.
- P4 — Not important and not urgent. Only do if time permits. I will add a due date to start, but it's okay to remove or move it without too much concern.

Okay, that's not the whole story. I don't use Priorities like this. I mostly use tags to signify what I'm working on.
