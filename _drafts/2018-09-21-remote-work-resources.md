Working from home has recently grown from a rare feature to an essential quality of life advantage for companies wise enough to offer the option.

This post is for you, fellow extravert, who is interested in this type of work.

I have spent 3 years working remotely, and the last year and a half have taught me practices I will implement from day one at my new remote job.

The greatest challenge is one of building trusted relationships, which depends on casual conversation alongside the professional. It’s easy enough to get lunch with a colleague at the office or chat about personal life throughout the day. Being fully remote has taught me that it takes more intention to get those casual interactions that are essential to team building and collaboration going forward. I address this with both short-term and long-term thinking.

First week:

* Be open. I find being the first to share details invites others to do so as well. I like to share a few slides or a short vlog to introduce myself. I will find what fits well with the culture and makes it easier for others to feel like they know more already.
* Join whatever channels are used to celebrate. I want to learn how my peers give non-social cues of affirmation. Whether that’s an internal message thanking someone or a public tweet with all the emojis, I find these little moments are what matter most.

First month:
* In the first 30 days, schedule 1:1 virtual coffee talks with everyone I know I will be working within the next quarter. Provide an agenda for those who prefer agendas (something as simple as who you are, what you do, how you like to communicate). Keep it casual and engaging to develop trust.

First quarter:
* If it's within budget, travel to meet colleagues my colleagues in person. The goal can be in the form of a project kickoff, attending the same conference, or be as casual as visiting someone in their hometown. The important part is to get face time when possible. As valuable as remote work is, nothing replaces the trust built by face-to-face communication.
* Find the optimal ways to celebrate both publicly and privately. As a leader at the intersection of multiple teams, I want to ensure I recognize my colleagues in a way that shows my appreciation and respect.

Another challenge I have learned to work around comes from scheduling. Years of remote work taught me to optimize for asynchronous collaboration while leaving time for the right amount of synchronous. A few lessons I keep in mind:

* Begin and end work intentionally. I have the benefit of a separate office space, which helps orient my mind around the different modes of the day. Have separate spaces if you can. I’ve had years to improve on a morning and evening ritual to give me space to transition between the two.
* Have fewer, more effective meetings. I like to challenge myself to drive decisions asynchronously and to keep meetings focused unless they are explicitly for brainstorming or team building.
* Default to public. I aim for sharing communications as broadly as possible. At my previous job, that meant answering individual requests to public channel when appropriate. Defaulting to public channels helps everyone have a shared context in a way I find beneficial to asynchronous decision making.
