description: Job hunting can be a terrible experience filled with panic. Use data to calm your nerves.
---

There is nothing like some unexpected job hunting to send a reasonbly confident person into a spiral of panic. I recounted my own experience with [recently in this post](2020-05-03-nonlinear-job-hunting.md). Thankfully, numbers are our friends when panic wants to set in.

I took a system I've used to help others through that realization and call it the [Job Hunting Pipeline Blueprint](https://bit.ly/JobPipelineBrueprint). Here are some guidelines to make the most of it. 

## Pick three jobs 

If you're like me and tend to live in the gaps of the org chart, you might find yourself applying to a diverse set of companies for a wide range of job titles. There's nothing wrong with that. What is a challenge, however, is seeing the pattern in chaos. 

Without a system that's capturing a pattern, every "no" feels like a **no to you** in totality: as an employee, sure, but it stings because it feels like its a no to you as a person. With a system, especially one that hinges on different job roles, you can see that a company is saying **no to you in that job at that company**. You can also begin to slice the idea of different job titles in any way you please.

- A range of types of jobs you enjoy: Sales Engineer, Software Engineer, Developer Advocate
- A range of seniority levels: Developer Advocate, Sr Developer Advocate, Director of Develop Relations
- Any other data point about the company: Startup Software Engineer,  (Late stage) Startup Software Engineer, Enterprise Software Engineer

A mutual exclusive separation makes the next steps clearer.

## Review the stages of job hunting

Lots of ways to parse this, here's mine TODO finish this. 

- 0 - Never Applied	Because it is easy to forget that we think about applying but sometimes forget to build momentum. You can't get what you don't apply for.
- 1 - Applied, No Reply	Because it's common to not hear back. See estimates in Pipeline.
- 2 - Response, No Interview Yet	Because it tells us they want to hear more. It's a sign the recruiter wants to move you forward.
- 3 - Phone Interview	Getting serious and always the next step. It's the first serious look at your communication skills.
- 4 - Job Interview	In person or remote, you're in the thick of it now. It's about your knowledge, clarity, and presentation.
- 5 - Second Interview	Most roles will get more detailed at this point. You have to show expertise and have detailed stories.
- 6 - Job Offer	You made it! It's time to negotiate.
- 7 - Accepted	Celebrate your big decision.
