description: Job hunting can be a terrible experience filled with panic. Use data to calm your nerves.
---

There is nothing like some unexpected job hunting to send a reasonbly confident person into a spiral of panic. I recounted my own experience with [recently in this post](2020-05-03-nonlinear-job-hunting.md). 

Thankfully, numbers can be our friends when panic wants to set in. Numbers have a clarifying effect on anxiety, shifting the broad stroke conclusions ("I'm never going to get an interview") to percentages ("I get an interview 40% of the time, so I better keep trying"). 

I took a system I've used to help others through that realization and call it the [Job Hunting Pipeline Blueprint](https://bit.ly/JobPipelineBrueprint). Here are some guidelines to make the most of it. 

## A no doesn't mean what you think it means

If you're like me and tend to live in the gaps of the org chart, you might find yourself applying to a diverse set of companies for a wide range of job titles. There's nothing wrong with that. What is a challenge, however, is seeing the pattern in chaos. 

Without a system that's capturing the pattern, every "no" feels like a **no to you** in totality: as an employee, sure, but it stings because it feels like its a no to you as a person. With a system, especially one that hinges on different job roles, you can see that a company is saying **no to you in that job at that company**. 

My trick to avoid the wrong conclusions is to pick three jobs you're pursuing. I like 3 because it's a magic number of sorts, but it also gives you the space to see what applications are working and which are not. You can slice the idea of different job titles in any way you please:

- A range of types of jobs you enjoy: Sales Engineer, Software Engineer, Developer Advocate
- A range of seniority levels: Developer Advocate, Sr Developer Advocate, Director of Develop Relations
- Any other data point about the company: Startup Software Engineer,  (Late stage) Startup Software Engineer, Enterprise Software Engineer

It's helpful to have distinct roles. Mutual exclusive separation makes the next steps clearer.


## Review the stages of job hunting


I think about the job process as a linear funnel. It’s not perfect, but it helps in a lot of ways. The big ones being that you know when you’re making progress and where you’re stalling. Here are my defaults:

- **0 - Never Applied:**	Because it is easy to forget that we think about applying but sometimes forget to build momentum. You can't get what you don't apply for.
- **1 - Applied, No Reply:** Because it's common to not hear back. See estimates in Pipeline.
- **2 - Response, No Interview Yet:**	Because it tells us they want to hear more. It's a sign the recruiter wants to move you forward.
- **3 - Phone Interview:**	It’s getting serious, so it’s the next major step. It's the first serious look at your communication skills. 
- **4 - Job Interview:**	In person or remote, you're in the thick of it now. It's about your knowledge, clarity, and presentation.
- **5 - Second Interview:**	Most roles will get more detailed at this point. You have to show expertise and have well-rehersed, detailed stories of your success.
- **6 - Job Offer:**	You made it! It's time to negotiate.
- **7 - Accepted	:** Celebrate your big decision.

These are my major states that lead toward pivots in what I want to study up on and how I talk about myself. In that way, I hope it’s helpful to use. The template _should_ let you edit these without issue, so you can make it your own. 

## Track your applications 

TODO 

## Check out the pipeline 

TODO percentages 

## Example insights

TODO.

- The job they wanted, DevRel, was not something they were interviewing well for. They ultimately decided to focus on other roles. 
- This person discovered inertia. Over 60% of the jobs they thought they'd applied to were incomplete. 
- When they did apply for other roles, they frequently got an interview. (92% conversion). Their resume was solid for those jobs.
- They found they heard back from Software Engineering jobs but only when they actually applied.
- When they saw certain titles got more response than others, they focused and feel less concerned when not hearing back from their #1 choice.
