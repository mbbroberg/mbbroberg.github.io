I have helped a lot of people refine a pitch: a one-liner that helps them effectively message who they are and what they do well. It started as part of [The Geek Whisperers](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/04/investing-in-career-insurance-vmware-user-group-recap-episode-110/), where we met with people to help them take the next step in their career. We were terribly underqualified, but that's never a concern. People need to talk to others--anyone--to refine their pitch. It's more a need for practice more than guidance.

That said, the single best detail you should change about your story is something I learned from one of these articles (that repeat each other): 

* [My Personal Formula for a Winning Resume](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/) (2014)
* [Google Recruiters Say Using the 'X-Y-Z Formula' on Your Resume Will Improve Your Odds of Getting Hired at Google](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html?cid=sf01003) (2019)

Regardless of the source, the formula is rock solid: 

> Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]

The articles have plenty of good examples. Check them out. 

## Think about your keywords 

Getting to an interview usually means getting past application tracking systems (ATS) as well as a deserning eye of a recruiter. Choose your pitch to include keywords that fit the specific job you're after, like described in [resume keywords to use and avoid](http://www.smarttalent.net/2015/01/16/kirkland-resume-keywords/). 

Another great strategy for keywords includes using [a competencies section](https://mbbroberg.fun/resume-competencies/). I hope the combination helps you land an interview. Then the real fun begins. 

If you're actively looking, I put together a helpful spreadsheet system I call the [Job Hunting Pipeline Blueprint](https://bit.ly/JobPipelineBrueprint). Let me know if it works for you by saying hello [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbbroberg).
