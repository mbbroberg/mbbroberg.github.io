## Hey 👋. I'm Matt.

<div class="homepage-intro">

I specialize in making complex systems delightfully simple for developers—navigating the messy middle between Infrastructure, Security, and Business stakeholders to ship products with measurable impact.

</div>

<div class="hiring-highlight">

**What I'm looking for (October 2025):** Product leadership roles where I can scale AI-augmented developer experiences, design internal platform products, or transform how organizations build and ship software.

</div>

### Recent obsessions

<div class="obsession-item">

**AI Integration at Scale** — Pioneering GenAI workflows (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) across enterprise platforms, reducing deployment time by 60% and onboarding by 50% while balancing innovation with governance.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Product Operating Models** — Transforming how platform teams work through better frameworks, value measurement, and systematic enablement. I love turning "we should explore AI" into shipped products with measurable ROI.

</div>
