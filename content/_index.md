## Hey üëã. I'm Matt.

I love building products developers love. I thrive as organizations scale by creating systems that keep priorities clear, defining value with metrics that matter, and coaching teams to grow with challenges. My leadership empowers through accountability, builds trust through transparency, and inspires everyone to be a catalyst for change.

### Teams I've managed: 

* Product management teams unifying all of engineering through the Target Application Platform (TAP)
* The product management team for Production Engineering at Target, including DevEx, SRE, and incident response
* The product, program, and content teams behind Red Hat's digital communities, including [Opensource.com](https://opensource.com)
* Community and marketing teams at Sensu, from seed to series A
* Leading the vision for product and DevRel in part of Intel managing open source projects, including [Snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/)
* Leading the vision for EMC's first international community advocacy and gamification programs
