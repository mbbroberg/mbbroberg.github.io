## Hey üëã. I'm Matt. 

I love connecting with technology communities to develop products and organic content to inspire open source adoption.

### Communities I'm a part of:

I work hard to connect and contribute to a broad range of communities of practice. Grouping in order of recency, that includes:

* **Python** programming language and **Go** programming language 
* **DevOps** (via the monitoring & observability sub-tribe)
* **Virtualization** (especially VMware), **Infosec**, and **Storage** (especially EMC and NetApp)

### Projects I've Contributed To:

I often open small PRs as I work through new problem or as a way of saying thank you to a project.
