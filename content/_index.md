## Hey 👋. I'm Matt.

<div class="homepage-intro">

I help developer tools companies become the obvious choice.

I've spent 15+ years figuring out why some developer tools become beloved and others are avoided. Three things I've learned:

- **Developers buy from people who understand their problems**, not people who pitch solutions
- **The best growth engine is a product operating model that understands its users**, helping them look smart at work
- **Community isn't a marketing channel**—it's your product's immune system

</div>

<div class="hiring-highlight">

**How I can help:** Leading product and developer-oriented storytelling teams to scale developer experiences, design internal platform products, and improve how organizations build, ship, and operate software (especially in AI-augmented workflows). Currently open to Director/Principal/Head roles in product, growth, and developer relations teams.

### Impact stories

<div class="obsession-item">

**Unifying an Internal Developer Platform** — At Target, I led a data-driven pivot from a 3-year ServiceNow-based "single pane of glass" to a unified internal developer platform (TAP). Using Kano surveys and GQM analysis, I enabled VP/SVP decisions to EOL the failing initiative and focus 300+ engineers on a common vision. TAP scaled to 95%+ developer adoption, unified 1,200+ engineers, and introduced "developer capacity unlocked" as the northstar metric that influenced how all developer experience value, including GenAI, was calculated.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Establishing Product Management Standards at Enterprise Scale** — I built a cross-functional working group to define modern PM standards anchored in SVPG's strategic positioning. Over 2.5 years, we developed a new skills assessment, trained and aligned 700 PMs, 300+ leaders, and 30+ executives on a common definition of product, transforming how Target evaluated and developed PM talent.

<div class="obsession-item">

**Repositioning Communities as Growth Engines** — At Red Hat, I led Digital Communities (23 people driving traffic comparable to RedHat.com). I repositioned these sites from publishing for page views to strategic awareness and acquisition engines. Using SEO/persona analysis to focus on high-intent topics, I redesigned four teams into a unified product-driven org, built a Salesforce integration POC connecting community behavior to pipeline signals, and influenced ~$25M in single-year bookings.
