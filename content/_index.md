## Hey 👋. I'm Matt.

<div class="homepage-intro">

I'm a Director of Product Management and product & growth leader focused on cloud platform engineering, internal developer platforms, observability, and experimentation-driven growth. I specialize in making complex systems delightfully simple for developers—navigating the messy middle between infrastructure, security, and business stakeholders to ship products with measurable impact.

</div>

<div class="hiring-highlight">

**How I can help:** Leading product teams to scale AI-augmented developer experiences, design internal platform products, and improve how organizations build, ship, and operate software. Currently open to Director/Principal/Head roles in product, growth, and platform engineering.

</div>

### Recent obsessions

<div class="obsession-item">

**AI Integration at Scale** — Pioneering GenAI workflows (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) across enterprise platforms, reducing deployment time by 60% and onboarding by 50% while balancing innovation with governance.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Product Operating Models** — Transforming how platform teams work through better frameworks, value measurement, and systematic enablement. I love turning "we should explore AI" into shipped products with measurable ROI.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Growth & Experimentation for DevTools** — Designing funnels, instrumentation, and A/B testing programs for developer tools and internal platforms; turning product usage and community signals into roadmap and go-to-market decisions.

</div>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

### Product domains I love

<div class="obsession-item">

**Cloud Platform Engineering & Internal Developer Platforms** — Scaled internal developer platform from pilot to 4,600+ weekly active users (92% adoption). Led $200M infrastructure portfolio: 500,000 containers, 50,000 VMs, 8PB storage serving 5,000 engineers with 99.99% reliability.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Observability & Incident Management Products** — Building telemetry and incident workflows as products, not just toolchains, to reduce MTTR and major incidents while giving SREs and executives the right signals.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**AI-Augmented Workflows** — Integrated GenAI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) across enterprise infrastructure, reducing deployment time by 60% and onboarding by 50%. Built AI-assisted documentation systems cutting planning time from 2 days to 3 hours.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Developer-Centric Educational Platforms** — Grew technical content platform from 10M to 22.4M visitors generating $25M in influenced pipeline. Achieved 3x deployment frequency through product-led operations and systematic friction removal.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Influential open source frameworks** — Led meaningful influence in observability, database, Kubernetes, and virtualization ecosystems through community-led growth and developer experience optimization.

</div>

### Community leadership

<div class="obsession-item">

**Communities I've built** — Co-founded [DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun) (2,000+ members). Co-hosted [The Geek Whisperers podcast](https://geek-whisperers.com/) (140 episodes, 100K+ listeners). Designed [Opensource.com](https://opensource.com) Correspondent program, [CHAOSScast](https://podcast.chaoss.community/), and [Enable Architect](https://redhat.com/architect). Led community programs for Sensu, Snap, EMC Elect, and Basho. I treat communities as part of the product surface, not a separate marketing channel.

</div>

<div class="obsession-item">

**Open source contributions** — Led [Kubernetes SIG contributor experience](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience). Defined [CHAOSS value metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value). See [my GitHub contributions](https://github.com/mbbroberg) for the many sprinkles of PRs I've shared across the internet.
