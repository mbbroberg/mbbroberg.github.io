Some of the most talented, thoughtful, and effective people I have ever worked with were recently laid off. It's such an emotional process, and I found myself sharing a few points that are worth writing down.

## Start where it hurts

It has to begin with your mindset: 

- Take a moment to feel whatever you're feeling. Anger, sadness, disappointment. It's all valid. Give yourself that space to feel it so you can have a chance of moving beyond it.
- That said, resist the urge to mind read. It can hold back healing when we focus on a person we're sure was out to get us or how a decision must have been personal. You have every right to be angry, but don't let it steal the time you have to think. Shift to the abundance mindset that knows there are lots of other roles out there for you.
- When you're ready, start. It took me a good 4-6 weeks to find and get through interviews last time I did, so use the runway you have to get started.
- Ask yourself: What are the 1-3 specific titles you think are right for your skills? What companies might need your specific expertise? Who do you know that can boost your visibility or intro you to a hiring manager?
- Lastly, let people help you. A lot of people care for you and want to see you succeed. Open up to those who can help and accept that they want to help you and that you could use the help.

I hope all of you find an even better place to work next.
