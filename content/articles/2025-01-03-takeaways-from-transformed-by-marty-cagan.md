I recently finished ["Transformed" by Marty Cagan and team](https://www.svpg.com/books/transformed-moving-to-the-product-operating-model/), and it's helping me connect some crucial dots about how modern product organizations actually work. Here are the key themes I'm continuing to grapple with afterwards.

## The IT vs Product Operating Model

The biggest eye-opener for me has been understanding the fundamental difference between IT and product operating models. You can spot an IT model when you hear people refer to "the business" as a separate entity making requests. In contrast, a product model implies an integrated and empowered team, solving customer problems in *ways that work for the business*.

This isn't just semantics - it completely changes how work gets done:

- In an IT model, business analysts translate stakeholder requests into requirements
- In a product model, product managers and designers work directly with stakeholders to understand underlying problems
- In an IT model, teams commit to delivering features by dates
- In a product model, teams commit to solving problems and demonstrating outcomes

I'm highlighting the contrasts, but the changes are more on a spectrum of frequency than a mutually exclusive state. Said another way, you can tell if you're in one model vs the other by *how frequently you hear the language* of that model.

## High-Integrity Commitments: A Different Way to Think About Dates

Zooming in on the delivery date topic is fascinating to me. Rather than treating every delivery as date-driven, they introduce "high-integrity commitments" - a formal process for those rare cases when a specific date really matters. 

What's fascinating is who makes these commitments: not executives, not sales, not even product managers - only the product team itself can commit to dates. And they can only do so after proper discovery work to derisk the solution.

This ties into a deeper truth I'm still processing: in modern product development, you often need multiple teams pursuing the same goal to derisk important deliveries. When I reflect on projects in my career that missed dates, I can see how having just one team per problem (common in IT models) set us up for challenges.

## Leadership as Coaching

Perhaps the most surprising insight is about product leadership role in the organization. The book suggests that coaching should take up to 80% of a product leader's time - far more than I typically see discussed. This isn't just mentoring; it's about helping teams transition from feature delivery to genuine problem-solving. 

In practice, I see leadership roles most often expected to be a "player-coach" model, which can be short-hand for a Principal PM with a side gig of mentorship. The team behind Transformed strongly believe in the leader being the accountable educator: not a consultant or a training team or a seminar. It's the leader's role to improve the practice. 

## Still Processing

There's a lot I'm still wrestling with:
- How do you maintain a mapping of the frequent and specific releases with larger strategic initiatives?
- How do you make headway in this model when parts of the organization still operate in an IT mindset?
- Is the implication of *all* leadership roles similar, ie shift to coaching rather than decisions? 

The book emphasizes that the product operating model isn't about standardization or common templates - it's about creating a culture of experimentation where innovation is prioritized over predictability. That's a profound shift in thinking about how modern businesses should operate.

If you're involved in product development at any level, I highly recommend picking up a copy. It's helping me see both where we're headed and why some of our current challenges exist.

Have you read it? I'd love to hear what insights resonated most with you.
