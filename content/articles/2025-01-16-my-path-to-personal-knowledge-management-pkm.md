My summary of a lifetime of effort...

## My Why 

I've learned two corollaries about my memory: 

- **I can't remember anything** without a point of reference
- **I can remember anything** when I 
	- Can draw it (ie decided on a mental model for it)
	- Connect it to other dots (ie find the pattern)

# Core Concepts

## Ontologies for Structure

> Developing specific categorical frameworks (ontologies) for the purpose of creating organizational patterns (structures).

- [Get Stuff Done](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done) (2015-2019) ‚Äì used GSD for years. For me, it's productivity to a fault
	- Always felt focused on the next task, which didn't grow with my mindset
- [Interstitial Journaling](https://betterhumans.pub/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef) (2019-) ‚Äì great idea I still use for temporal trains of thought
- [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de) ‚Äì read about it, never tried it; doesn't entice me
- [Life OS](https://www.yearzero.io/) (2021-2023) ‚Äì I got into the cult of Life Design with August Bradley for a bit
	- Looks thoughtful, but doesn't hold up
	- Lots of clicks and clean up tasks that give a false sense of productivity
	- Anyone who's normalized a dataset will find the design offensive
- [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) (2023-2024) ‚Äì good structure for project-focused knowledge
	- Great default of "dump to Archive" to keep it relevant
	- Areas vs Resources takes too much effort to differentiate
	- Ultimately about sorting things, which I'm working to stop
- [Evolving ‚Äì more at the end](#evolution-in-progress) (2025) ‚Äì I'm toying with a new idea 
	- Emphasis on pattern emergence over linear projects
	- Integrates commitments but more about experimentation
	- Limited structure as an [enabling constraint](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/making-things-better-with-enabling)


### Models for Task Management

> Not about choosing a system to be effective, it's about finding one with categories that match how I naturally think.

- [Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent / Important)](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix) ‚Äì urgency doesn't align well to how I think
- [1-3-5 Rule](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-better-todo-list-the-135-rule) ‚Äì huge help as an individual contributor, hasn't been as much as a leader 
- [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban#:~:text=In%20Japanese%2C%20kanban%20literally%20translates,in%20a%20highly%20visual%20manner.) ‚Äì core to how I think; I design for pull instead of push, limit work in progress
- [LNO (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead)](https://www.dualoop.com/blog/shreyas-doshi-the-lno-effectiveness-framework) ‚Äì definitely helping me as a leader, could have been helpful as an IC

## Core Tools 

- Omnifocus (2005-2007)
- Evernote (2007-2018) ‚ò†Ô∏èü™¶ <- this hurt
- Trello (2012-2021)
- Asana (2013-2017)
- Todoist (2017-2023)
- Notion (2019-2023)
- Reminders (2023-)
- Obsidian (2023-) ‚Äì depends on a small but essential list of plugins, and then a ton more to play

## Types of Notes

- **Knowledge Management** ‚Äî centralizing then ~~connecting related information on~~ engaging with a topic
	- *Recent change (Jan 2025)*: I'm shifting from a "gather and organize" to "recognize patterns and experiment" 
- **Task Management** ‚Äî track what I commit to and complete the most impactful work
	- Project management as a subcomponent to this larger theme
- **Daily Flow** ‚Äì time is my default mental model  (and the Obsidian plugins that make it possible)
	- Daily notes as a core intersticle journal (Period Notes)
	- Process for low friction capture (QuickAdd)
	- Custom views for feedback loops (Dataview)
		- Clarity of focus
		- Visibility progress
		- Interesting patterns
- **Creative Flow** ‚Äî I'm a maker, not only a consumer
	- Draw and write freely but backed by a system to find opportunities for reuse
	- Identify opportunities to share publicly without complexity and with assurances of privacy when I need them
	- Space to tinker with code contributions in minor ways to open source (thank you [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) community)
- **Portability**
	- Systematize preferences for reuse across environments (dotfile management)

## NON GOALS

What once interests me but is no longer what I need: 
- **Productivity optimization** ‚Äî I now work with my energy rather than rely on willpower
- **Digital hoarding** ‚Äì clipping everything I can to *feel* like I learned it

## Evolution In Progress

- Habit: every time I get a bit of free time, I consider replatforming for some reason
	-  the platform is not (never?) the problem
	-  the pattern is the problem

Why? The intersection of task management and knowledge management is a mess. 

-  **Old pattern**:
	- Offload every wishlist idea in the world into my system
	- Complete a small percentage
	- Carry over a debt of todos
	- Get overwhelmed
	- Extend that logic to my knowledge management
  	    - Carry over a debt of knowledge topics
  	    - Read a higher percentage of it
  	    - Never apply it 
  	    - Forget it
  	    - Get sad that I forgot
-  **New pattern**:
	-  Differentiate the small number of commitments from the infinite amount of exploration 
		- Keep a tiny list of larger ideas I'm committed to completing
		- Anything smaller can go elsewhere to not overwhelm this system
  		    - Small things = iOS Reminders | Big things = Obsidian
	- Knowledge management via concept exploration is most of Obsidian now
		- Forgot why I was doing something? Define the `Ideal` state before I veer off
		- Overwhelmed by interesting ideas? Focus on the `Emergent Pattern` rather than raw inputs,
		- Want to really learn? Find a path to apply through `Experimenting`
		- Don't get into it as much as I planned? No shame, but don't carry the debt ‚Äì clear them: `fn Cancel Incomplete TODOs` (`fn` are my custom functions via [Templater](https://zachyoung.dev/posts/templater-snippets) in Obsidian)
