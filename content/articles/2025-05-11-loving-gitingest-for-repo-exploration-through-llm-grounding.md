# I'm Loving GitIngest for Repo Exploration through LLM Grounding

I've added a new tool–GitIngest–to my digital toolchain, and it's been foundational to how I interact with LLMs.

## What makes GitIngest valuable?

When exploring unfamiliar codebases or trying to provide AI tools with proper context, having a clean extraction of repository content makes all the difference. GitIngest does precisely this – it pulls repository content and metadata in a format that's perfect for analysis.

The most elegant part of the experience is how simple it is to use:

```bash
gitingest https://github.com/mbbroberg.github.io
```

The perfect shortcut is that **you can also replace `hub` with `ingest` in any GitHub URL.** So `github.com/user/repo`becomes `gitingest.com/user/repo`. These ease of use is the kind of thoughtful design that makes me appreciate developer tools.

## Working with GitHub Enterprise

For those of us dealing with GitHub Enterprise instances that aren't web-accessible, you can also build gitingest locally:

bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest
# Then follow build instructions
```

I've integrated this into my troubleshooting routine – whenever I need to deeply understand a repository or use it as grounding for AI conversations, gitingest creates the perfect reference file. I also leave `digest.txt` files in repositories I maintain now and advise users to ground to it before digging in.

## Beyond the obvious use case

Similar to how I've evolved my relationship with Obsidian – shifting from "gather and organize" to "recognize patterns and experiment" – gitingest is changing how I approach repository exploration.

It's not revolutionary technology, but it's one of those tools that removes just enough friction to change how you work. The best tools often do exactly that.

What repository exploration tools have you found useful lately? I'd be curious to hear about your workflow.
