# When Platform Products Fail - About Maps, Domains, Topologies

I've been thinking about why platforms fail during organizational evolution, and I think the answer lies at the intersection of three mental models: Wardley Maps, Domain-Driven Design, and Team Topologies.

## The Misalignment Problem

- **Wardley Maps** show us that everything evolves from genesis to commodity along predictable stages. They reveal how platforms fail not because they're technically wrong, but because they're evolutionarily mismanaged. 

- **Domain-Driven Design** provides coherence boundaries. Teams within the same bounded context share language, purpose, and change cycles. Platforms serving coherent bounded contexts can evolve predictably even across organizational lines.

- **Team Topologies** defines the interaction patterns. Stream-aligned teams consume platform capabilities. Platform groups provide them. Enabling teams help with adoption. The organizational lines matter less than the interaction clarity.

Consider an internal API gateway serving teams across different evolutionary stages. The authentication component is well-understood and stable (product/commodity stage). The GraphQL federation layer is still experimental (genesis/custom stage). The audit logging sits somewhere in between.

The platform spans all evolutionary stages—and that's not the problem. The problem emerges when platform management doesn't match the maturity requirements of the most mature components.

## Maturity Models as Alignment Tools

Platforms spanning evolutionary stages need **meaningful release strategies** that acknowledge these differences. Alpha, beta, and GA designations aren't just technical markers—they're organizational contracts about reliability expectations.

The extension model becomes critical. Experimental capabilities need different support models than supported ones. Teams consuming genesis-stage platform features expect instability and rapid iteration. Teams consuming commodity-stage features expect reliability and backward compatibility.

When platforms treat all capabilities with the same maturity model, they either over-engineer experimental features or under-support stable ones. Both paths lead to misaligned value delivery.

## Value Streams Cross Organizational Boundaries

Platform value streams will always cross organizational boundaries. This works when business value measures align and leadership incentives point in the same direction.

Misaligned incentives resolve when three elements align:

1. **Bounded contexts** maintain coherent domain understanding
2. **Team boundaries** enable clear interaction patterns  
3. **Maturity models** match evolutionary stage requirements

When these align, platforms become time-saving products. They reduce toil for teams by absorbing evolutionary complexity rather than exposing it to every consumer.

Most platform failures aren't technical failures—they're maturity model failures. Organizations that get the evolution strategy right find the technology tends to follow.
