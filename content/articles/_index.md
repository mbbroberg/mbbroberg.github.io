I write about the craft of building software organizations—the intersection of product management, developer experience, and platform engineering. These articles explore the messy middle between shipping software users love and understanding the systems that get it there.

Some pieces are polished reflections on lessons learned. Others are works in progress, thinking out loud about problems I'm wrestling with. Browse by date below or explore by topic using the tags.
