My summary of a lifetime of effort...

## My Why 

I've learned two corollaries about my memory: 

- ==I can't remember anything== without a point of reference
- ==I can remember anything== when I 
	- Can draw it (ie decided on a mental model for it)
	- Connect it to other dots (ie find the pattern)

## Core Concepts

### Ontologies for Structure

- [Get Stuff Done](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done) (GSD) – used for many years but felt messy and overly focused on the next task (2015-2019)
- [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de) – never tried it; doesn't entice me
- [Interstitial Journaling](https://betterhumans.pub/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef) – still use it in parts of my flow (2019-)
- [Life OS](https://www.yearzero.io/) – got into the cult of Life Design with August Bradley (2021-2023ish)
- [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) – good structure for project-focused knowledge (2023-2024)
- [TBD – Evolving] – I'm toying with a new idea emphasizing emergent over linear though 

### Models for Task Management

- [Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent / Important)](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix) – urgency doesn't align well to how I think
- [1-3-5 Rule](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-better-todo-list-the-135-rule) – huge help as an individual contributor, hasn't been as much lately 
- [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban#:~:text=In%20Japanese%2C%20kanban%20literally%20translates,in%20a%20highly%20visual%20manner.) – core to how I think; I design for pull instead of push, limit work in progress 

### Core Tools 

- Omnifocus (2005-2007)
- Evernote (2007-2018) ☠️🪦 <- this hurt
- Trello (2012-2021)
- Asana (2013-2017)
- Todoist (2017-2023)
- Notion (2019-2023)
- Reminders (2023-)
- Obsidian (2023-)

### Types of Notes

- **Knowledge Management** — centralizing then connecting related information on a topic
	- *Recent change*: I'm shifting from a "gather and organize" to "recognize patterns and experiment" 
- **Task Management** — track what I commit to and complete the most impactful work
	- Project management as a subcomponent to this larger theme
- **Daily Flow**
	- Daily notes as a core intersticle journal (Period Notes)
	- Process for low friction capture (QuickAdd)
	- Custom views for feedback loops to motivate myself (Dataview)
		- Clarity of focus
		- Faster task review
		- Visibility progress
- **Creative Flow**
	- Draw and write freely but backed by a system to find opportunities for reuse
	- Identify opportunities to share publicly without complexity and with assurances of privacy
	- Space to tinker with contributes in minor ways to open source
- **Portability**
	- Systematize preferences for reuse across environments

### NON GOALS

What once interests me but is no longer what I need: 
- Productivity optimization — I now work with my energy rather than rely on willpower
- Digital hoarding – clipping everything I can to *feel* like I learned it

### Lessons in Task Management

- every time I get a bit of free time, I consider replatforming for some reason
	- ! the platform is not (never?) the problem
	- $ the pattern is the problem
- ! Old pattern:
	- Offload every wishlist idea in the world into my list
	- Complete a small percentage
	- Carry over a debt of todos
	- Get overwhelmed
- @ New Idea
	- @ Differentiate the small number of commitments from the infinite amount of exploration 
		- Keep a list of FEWER THAN 5 things in my task manager 
			- Small things = Reminders | Big things = Obsidian
	- Concept exploration is most of Obsidian now
	- Supported by new, low-friction habits
		- Don't get to it? Don't carry the debt – clear them: fn Cancel Incomplete TODOs
		- Forgot why I was doing something? Define the `Ideal` state before I veer off
		- Overwhelmed by interesting ideas? Focus on the `Emergent Pattern` rather than raw inputs, and find a path to `Experimenting`
