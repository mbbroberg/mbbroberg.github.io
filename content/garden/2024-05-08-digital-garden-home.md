I'm trying out extending my [website](https://mbbroberg.fun) with a digital garden, which feels more aligned to my increasing preference for 2024-05-12-rhizomes rather than tree-centric metaphors.

The site name is a play off "lossy" 2023-08-18-my-mental-models-intersections, which I am sure to reflect in my thoughts here.

## Take a Look around

This space is how I organize my daily [personal knowledge management](Learning/Concepts/My%20path%20to%20Personal%20Knowledge%20Management%20(PKM).md). I also have an evolving tagging strategy that Build a Digital Garden.
