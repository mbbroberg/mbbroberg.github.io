Itâ€™s almost like the 18th century^1 understanding of human faculties is not holding up.

Kahneman: "Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasonable argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model."
