> *In Greek, "timē" (τιμή) remarkably means both "honor/respect" and "price/value"*

- A core theme in [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years) by anthropologist [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber "David Graeber")

Interesting because: 

- It's evidence that Graeber's argument of economic relationships ***emerging from*** social and moral relationships, not the other way around
- ie Before we had cash to own anyone, we owed our extended social network our time
- Corollary: We once had to **value specific relationships over money** since value wasn't fungible, it was social
- Questions (or even disproves) foundational beliefs of economics as a clean and separate science from studies of humans (sociology, anthropology, psychology) when it isn't

Specifically, debt has always been part of human socialization: 

1. Exchanges were embedded in social relationships
2. Gift-giving creates obligations and status
3. Value was inseparable from social standing

The semantic overlap isn't just a linguistic curiosity but reflects how people conceptualized value before the development of market economies.

### Takeaway? 

The most compelling pattern isn't necessarily a direct etymological link between "time" words across languages, but rather how many early societies show conceptual overlaps between:

- Honor/respect
- Proper timing/season
- Value/worth

Graeber's observation seems to identify a genuine pattern. 

We seem to believe human worth can be separated cleanly into economic and social spheres when there's never been one without the other.
