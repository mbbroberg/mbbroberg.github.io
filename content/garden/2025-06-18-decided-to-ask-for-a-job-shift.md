It's Wed Jun 18 09:48pm and I'm thinking about what’s unfolded in the last couple of weeks. 

After my frustrations… after reaching a level of work anger I haven’t in years and deciding I don’t want to continue down the exact same path, I made a few calls: 

Wants 
- I won’t keep doing what I’m doing the same way
- I want commitment from leaders depending on my work to use the systems they ask me to make
- I will find a way to shift the negativity of PPMs from me buffering it to them directly getting what they’re asking for — for better or worse

Needs 
- *Report to someone who gives a shit about my skill set* and knows more about it than I do
- Stop over-indexing on improving practices engineering leaders should lead *since I now know it’s not even valued* and instead map them to my interests

Specifics and current understanding of why I intuited it
- Move from Cloud Platform space — it’s too crowded for me to be visible 
- Ask for time for ProdOps > more below 
- Said that means I need fewer people to manage > scary but satisfying shift tbh


Going from 
- 2 extremely needy top performers 
- 1 PIP ready OOO 
- 2 new to role 

To 
- 1 promo ready, dialed in
- 1 open 

Kindest thing to myself? Get a really fucking good PM in place. 
- Idk if I’ve seen one, though, that absolutely nails it… and I know it well for the most part so they’ll have to compete with how I look to the team (and still be interesting to the team—challenge with Bill)
Option 2? Open for promo + L5 from the fellowship or similar internal
- Risk in understaffing complex domain with lots of room to improve and core to 2025/26 goals. Is that the move? Idk

Either way it’s 3-4 FEWER NEEDY ICs 🙂‍↔️. That feels nice to even thing about… that’s 3-4 hours a week back to me before paperwork and other overhead.

---


My next step → 
1. Use my own responsibilities shifting template from past ICs for myself 

Changes: 
- What ProdOps investment means specifically
	- POM is a platform product. I need a list of my features, their maturity and specs. I need to understand and group my customers. I want this to *feel great* for users.
	- I’m accountable clarifying how they lead to alignment from SrDOT to SVP and across peers
	- I don’t run routines or solely own our artifacts
- Immediate Efforts
	- Map Adam’s OKR practices to John’s use of my eio model
		- Audit core routines & artifacts along with Nate for Infra all 
- Expectations
	- Regular connects with leaders on clarity and flow of information
- CP handoffs — tldr on opens, status, current rec 
	- Introducing a Journey product 
	- Sowjanya and Richard spaces 
	- IAM partnership
	- SOX compliance 
	- DBaaS distraction 
	- GH messaging / S3C 
- Routines I own? 
	- SRE sync if still needed (I’ll cancel)
	- wow I really don’t own much these days :) 

Stays with me: 
- Still a DOP for TAP
	it’s not a single product and I plan to lead by example on how we distribute that sense of ownership 
- `cloud-platform` stays! 
	- Mel join as a stakeholder/contributor
	- Discuss keeping what’s working and cut out what isn’t (ie steering)

Opens: 
- PM Routines — value in shifting to C&C wide right away or decide after analysis? 
- Miro Group — open it up to C&C all 




### Following the mental thread to Prat pitch 
it’s 10:21pm and I can’t quite go to sleep yet to trying to clear the deck. 

Analogy of platform strategy working. 3 concrete examples: 
- *Enabling constraints accelerates productivity* — immutable identities, deterministic relationships, discoverable services. This leads to 100hrs per IC saved per year 2.5 weeks worth of productivity! (Get real number, make it tangible)
- *Define the core, design for extension* — I can’t / won’t ever have time to own all social communication constructs. But we can give people confidence in the core and options to expand.
- *See cultural change as part of the product* — how TAP shows up, from ATMs to Demo Days to beyond, is core to its success. It breaks down silos, aligns incentives, and gets results over politics

My pitch 
- Get incrementally better where we most need it 
- Leverage dashboards as incentive system rather than governance or mandate
- Bet 1: Intentional Communication 
	- Create confidence in how and where to find each other
		- Reduces MTTR, forcing 
	- Deterministic mappings between a common denominator of collaboration tools. 
	- P1: Slack to listservs
	- P2: Slack to Sharepoint to Confluence
	- More: Exhaustive look at TOC constructs (maybe start there?)
- Bet 2: POM Discoverability 
	- We all get better when I can *know without a moment of doubt where to find each other*
	- Clear default artifact mappings that set an expectation of accountability per level / role
	- Know exactly where to find key artifacts from Q/Q OKRs to 3-5y Vision
	- When an org is struggling, be able to debug it fast, looking for missing/stale artifacts
- Bet 3: Team Topology & Backlog upleveling 
	- Focus in on backlog management aligning to meaningful team topologies 
	- Where dependencies are most frequent and painful, study it 
	- Design a self-service tool custom to Target for “is my team healthy?” 
- Bet 0(?): Target Tech product 
	- Fully structure us to maturity
	- Explicitly don’t staff projects, do pull PMs by other titles into the role. Reassign PMs who aren’t to other bucket.-
	- Role type: CoS to S/VP 


Product explicit approval  of work items. 
- metadata on IAM? Could see all the systems that aren’t strategically accounted for 


Future beyond blossom 
- 

Bonus 
- Anchors to a well established truth: Conway’s Law > Reverse Conway Method 

### framing
Part of my opening with him: I have been wanting to do product here from day 1. I’ve most often been other things: cos, pe

I have 2-3 big investments I want to bet on and 3-5 ways to get to better results

Align Target Tech to value 
- Shift staff to centralize Product org > including prodops like everyone else 
- KPI: Land developer capacity as a company metric for b2b > expect orgs to align to it, eki level reporting on revenue blocked by capacity 

Accelerate POM maturity 
- define anchor routines and artifact > establish pulse up to prat that’s more dependable 
	- why? People lost on how to shift so take forever. 4 quarters into pivot of iam vision, all agreed… still stuck. Data mobility - too org chart based and not VSM 
	- monthly to 6 week cadence would
- publish missing guidelines (sane defaults and mental model) > product, eng practices, R&R
- shift communication topology > this is my favorite bet > deterministic connection 

Results of each are more than hypothetical or anecdotal >> principle meets well earned practice 

TT > only able to articulate and represent our work up to the level of product staffing. N of 50?? Should quantify 

POM > every level seems themselves as diff teams. That turns anything we produce into a dependency nightmare that flattens to waterfall
