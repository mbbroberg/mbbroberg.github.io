# ðŸŒ± mossy mental models 

*I'm trying out extending my website with a digital garden*, which feels more aligned to my increasing preference for horizontal organic growth rather than tree-centric metaphors.

The name is a play off **"lossy" mental models**, which I am sure to reflect in my thoughts here.
