I'm trying out extending my [website](https://mbbroberg.fun) with a digital garden, which feels more aligned to my increasing preference for horizontal organic growth rather than tree-centric metaphors.

The site name is a play off "lossy" mental models, which I am sure to reflect in my thoughts here.
