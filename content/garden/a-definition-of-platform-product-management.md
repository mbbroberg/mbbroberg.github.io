From [Marty Cagan's work on platform product management](https://www.svpg.com/platform-product-management/):

> _"A platform is a set of capabilities that are exposed through APIs or other interfaces and which are used by other products to build or enhance their offerings."_

What it's **not**:

> _"There are too many so-called 'platforms' out there that are really just unfinished products. The team didn't do the work required to provide a complete solution, so they market it as a platform and push the work off on the customer or a developer to finish."_

## Takeaways

Platform product management is about creating capabilities that enable other products rather than solving end-user problems directly. It requires a different mindset from traditional product work—you're building for builders, not end users.

The risk is calling something a "platform" when it's actually just incomplete. Meaningful platforms provide finished, reliable capabilities that other teams can build upon–that they *want* to build on. They reduce complexity and friction for their consumers, not increase it.

This links to skills of: 

- **Value definition**: Platform teams are often several layers removed from end customers and revenue. Success requires defining metrics that are leading indicators of downstream product success, not just platform adoption.
- **Community-based go-to-market**: Successful platforms depend on user communities that extend and evangelize the platform as much as the core team maintains it. This requires applying community practices, like those from [Community practices I learned from Cathedral and the Bazaar](community-practices-i-learned-from-cathedral-and-the-bazaar)."
- **Extensibility**: every platform needs a way for others to extend its capabilities to get out of the firefight of feature requests and dissatisfied users using alternatives. The naming choice signals intent and audience. More in [Platform Extensibility Models](platform-product-extension-model-language)
