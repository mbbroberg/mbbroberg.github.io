I wanted to generate a picture for a blog post, so I threw in a prompt: 

> Generate a website header image for a post on gitingest and how cool it is. Use a 2d illustrated style that's light and fun, like a Buffer.com feature.

It did alright. Nothing great, nothing terrible.

But then I hit the "Improve Prompt" button and got this: 

> A whimsically animated Gitingest creature, brimming with playful energy despite its virtual existence. This charming character is depicted in a 2D illustrated style, reminiscent of a feature on Buffer.com, exuding a light and fun vibe. Its vibrant colors pop against a minimalist background, showcasing intricate details in its pixelated design. The image radiates a sense of joy and creativity, making it a delightful addition to any blog post on the coolness of Gitingest.

What it produced was **magical**.

I have literally no use for it... but I'm somehow impressed. There's a linguistic fluffing full of descriptors – "charming," "reminiscent," "radiates," "delightful" – that I would not have thought to add on my own, but seems to make all the difference. 

As a word nerd fiddling with technology, I have a lot of reading to do.
