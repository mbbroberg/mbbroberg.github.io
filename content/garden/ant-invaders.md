# Ant Invaders

Their trail leads to places I deem my own, which leads to conflict.

Following a destiny invisible to the naked eye; goal clearly set by those before it; follow the leader - middle of the pack - dependable direction in reach. Three segmented parts, six legs originating from the thorax. No individuality. Live for others.

Right before the grooves of my uniquely-identifying fourth digit pressed down to selfish ends, audibly invading my invaderâ€™s insides, I wonder for a moment if he ever had a headache.
