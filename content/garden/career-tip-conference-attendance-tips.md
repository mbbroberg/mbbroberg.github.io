Thinking about this since a friend asked and I'm surprised I don't have a write up...

> >  My short version is: choose a strategy, manage your energy more than your time, remember everyone has common interests.

Strategy: my top two are _specific outcome_ or _serendipity_. Both include looking at the schedule ahead of time, but the former is researching speakers and setting an intention to talk to specific people about questions I can't easily search myself. Serendipity is all about maximizing connection through little interactions.

Energy: for me that's no back-to-back talks so I can review notes or continue side conversations w/someone, save time to walk the vendor booths for new ideas, hydrate and have energizing snacks, bring headphones to give myself some quiet time.

Common interest: everyone there has at least open source as a connection point. That gives an easy conversation starter that's more interesting than "where do you work" (which is also okay, but can come reflexive and get into a well-worn path of boring conversation). "What's your connection to open source" is an inclusive way to let people answer about what they use it for, how they contribute, or if it's just part of the day job.
