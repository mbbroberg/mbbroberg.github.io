I love that I stumbled across this on [an old internet friend's site](https://www.curiouslychase.com/posts/literate-programming/):

> Literate Programming is a concept introduced by the renowned computer scientist Donald Knuth.
>
> This methodology entwines code with documentation, promoting a deep and integral relationship between the two, resulting in improved comprehension and maintainability of programs.
