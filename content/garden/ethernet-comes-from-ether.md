[up:: [Etymology reveals implicit cognitive framing](etymology-reveals-implicit-cognitive-framing)]

**Fun Fact Etymology.**

I was perusing ArsTechnica’s [impressive breakdown of the history/future of the wires underlying the internet](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/07/ethernet-how-does-it-work.ars) and came across this historical factoid:

_**The name [“Ethernet”] comes from the luminiferous ether that was at one point thought to be the medium through which electromagnetic waves propagate, like sound waves propagate through air.**_

There’s something about that explanation that reminds me of how curious it is that technology works. Ethernet feels magical.
