## Learning Log 
- [learning:: Etymology serves as an archaeological tool for uncovering implicit cognitive frames] | next:: Notice when new etymological discoveries reveal surprising frames | date: 2024-01-02
- [learning:: Etymological awareness can help identify & counteract cognitive biases by making implicit frames explicit]
- [learning:: Physical metaphors persist in modern usage | next: Map connection to cognitive biases | date: 2024-01-02]
## Pattern

- [learning:: Etymology reveals embodied metaphors in cognitive frames]
- [learning:: Etymology often reveals historical cognitive frames that still shape our thinking today]

Common etymological patterns show how abstract concepts are understood through physical/embodied experience:
- "understand" (stand under) -> knowledge as physical structure
- "consider" (with stars) -> thinking as celestial observation
- "curriculum" (racing chariot) -> learning as competition

## Context
This pattern keeps emerging when I notice etymological roots that expose how people historically conceptualized abstract ideas through physical metaphors:
- Abstract concepts are frequently grounded in physical/spatial metaphors
- These inherited frames can limit or enable our thinking in ways we don't consciously recognize
- The metaphors often persist even when we've lost conscious connection to the original meaning

This pattern appears strongest in:
- Abstract concept words (thinking, learning, knowing)
- Emotional/mental state descriptions
- Process/methodology terms
