## Core Pattern

[learning:: Etymology reveals how abstract concepts are grounded in physical/embodied metaphors, exposing historical cognitive frames that continue to shape our thinking today.]

## Evidence & Examples

Common etymological patterns showing embodied metaphors in abstract concepts:
- "understand" (stand under) → knowledge as physical structure
- "consider" (with stars) → thinking as celestial observation  
- "curriculum" (racing chariot) → learning as competition

This pattern appears strongest in:
- Abstract concept words (thinking, learning, knowing)
- Emotional/mental state descriptions
- Process/methodology terms

## Implications & Applications

- Etymological awareness can help identify & counteract cognitive biases by making implicit frames explicit
- These inherited frames can limit or enable our thinking in ways we don't consciously recognize
- The metaphors often persist even when we've lost conscious connection to the original meaning
