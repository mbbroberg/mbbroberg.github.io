## My Understanding 

Freedom can be both the *absence* of constriction and the *presence* of a capability. It can be misleading to focus on just one aspect of freedom and call it complete. 

The right to act without interference is an option. I have many options that will never be acted on because of all the little frictions of life. 

An environment designed to encourage an understanding of and investment in self-direction is not equivalent to the absence of a looming threat if I do. 

Said in a way that might click: goodness is not the absence of badness. That's a misunderstanding of terms. Goodness requires the presence of something. And I think the same of freedom.
