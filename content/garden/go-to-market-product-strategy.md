These are thoughts that turned to stickies that turned into my default playbook. I'll integrate them further into #product-management eventually, but for now: 

- Do fewer things better (fewer use cases, fewer personas, fewer promises)
- Always be valuable to specific people rather than general groups or broad personas 
- Get to a great “win” story as soon as possible (by following the above)
- Scale from white glove to 1:many through community practices
- Remember the total addressable market (TAM) is not the same as the serviceable obtainable market (SOM)
- Know the user journey inside and out (including when they choose to not use our product or stop using it)
- Remember that adoption takes time.
