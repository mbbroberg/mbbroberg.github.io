# Goya’s Saturn

A favorite terrifying moment in [Art History](art-history).

Saturn in Roman mythology is Cronus in Greek myths–father of all the gods. He's told of a prophesy that one of his children will kill him–so upon birth–the story is he swallowed them all (until he was deceived).

Goya's depiction is less cutesy than what I imagined before seeing it.
