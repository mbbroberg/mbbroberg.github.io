> *Money existed, but it was not used to buy anything; important men lived their lives in pursuit of honor, which took material form in followers and treasure. Treasures were given as gifts, awarded as prizes, carried off as loot. This is no doubt how time first came to mean both "honor" and "price"*

- A core theme in [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years) by anthropologist [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber "David Graeber")

Interesting because: 

- It's evidence that Graeber's argument of economic relationships ***emerging from*** social and moral relationships, not the other way around
- ie Before we had cash to own anyone, we owed our extended social network our time
- Corollary: We once had to **value specific relationships over money** since value wasn't fungible, it was social
- Questions (or even disproves) foundational beliefs of economics as a clean and separate science from studies of humans (sociology, anthropology, psychology) when it isn't

Specifically, debt has always been part of human socialization: 

1. Exchanges were embedded in social relationships
2. Gift-giving creates obligations and status
3. Value was inseparable from social standing

The semantic overlap isn't just a linguistic curiosity but reflects how people conceptualized value before the development of market economies.

### Takeaway? 

The most compelling pattern isn't necessarily a direct etymological link between "time" words across languages, but rather how many early societies show conceptual overlaps between:

- Honor/respect
- Proper timing/season
- Value/worth

Graeber's observation seems to identify a genuine pattern. 

We seem to believe human worth can be separated cleanly into economic and social spheres when there's never been one without the other.
