Part of Learn new approaches to intimacy

Log: 
- Make something that outlines interests using the common concept of a menu 
- Discussed during therapy — started to get vague or general that it *could* be this or *could* be that and I did have a healthy but heated thought: that doesn’t work for me. It’s either a concept that we leverage for clarity or it’s just another part of the ambiguity that has me lost. We opted for the former.
- I also don’t need a list focused on completeness… I need to learn the basics of formulating an experience so I can get used to it. It’s following a recipe while I get comfortable cooking. 

## Our Menu

## Erotic Menus 
Guidance we discussed in therapy: 

Appetizers – any foreplay we’re interested in or other scene setting / warming up 
Main Course – assume this will be how one or both of us orgasm; what would be fun to get there
Dessert – anything we want to say / do to reinforce the scene and then provide aftercare

## Yes No Maybe lists

[Babeland](https://www.babeland.com/babe-blog/how-tos/yes-no-maybe) - Y/N/M lists. Simpler than what we already filled out together. 
- Be as specific as you'd like to be - note things like giving, receiving, both, when, where, or how – just, again, make sure you are speaking specifically to _your_ wants and needs.
