# Learning demands change

> > 
> Unlike education, learning demands change. Learning makes us incompetent just before it enables us to grasp mastery. Learning opens our eyes and changes the way we see, communicate and act.

From [Seth Godin](https://www.unscrambled.sg/2020/04/18/seth-godin-you-can-learn-just-about-anything-now-so-what-did-you-learn-today/). 

Reminds me how the lull of productivity after the decision to try a new pattern or grow a new skill. There are multiple points of inflection: 

- Is this worth continuing? How do I know? 
- What changes? What doesn't?

Pursuit of newness always implies a hypothesis.
