# My Mental Models Intersections

> >  Summary
> Mental models are ways to see the world. It assumes that there is no knowable objectivity to be had, only an increasingly thoughtful ways of conceptualizing the subjective window we have available to us.

> >  Why I care
>
> All understanding of the world is based on my mental model of the question at hand. It's the metaphor, the cognitive frame, the ideology, the ghost in the system of thought few introspect deeply enough to see.
>
> I both like to **collect** mental models and **learn to apply** them to the way I see the world. The more options I understand, the greater clarity I can achieve in my thinking.

I remain incredibly curious about

- [On Causation – is this my focus](on-causation-is-this-my-focus) and thinkers who explore what counts as causal vs not
- [Cognitive Frames MOC](cognitive-frames-moc) of [George Lakoff on Frames MOC](george-lakoff-on-frames-moc) backed by [Daniel Kahneman](daniel-kahneman)
- [Dialectics](dialectics) of Hegel and explored though [Philosophers – Deleuze and Guattari](philosophers-deleuze-and-guattari) and [Philosopher – Zizek, Slavoj](philosopher-zizek-slavoj)
- [Team Topologies](team-topologies)

I apply them regularly as I pursue understanding of

- Myself through [Therapy](on-my-mental-health-therapy) and [Journal of Important Moments](journal-of-important-moments)

I put them into action through

- [Templates](templates)
