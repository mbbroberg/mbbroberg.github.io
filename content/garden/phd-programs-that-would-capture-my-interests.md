1. Cognitive Science - This interdisciplinary field would allow you to explore the mental structures underlying causation while drawing from psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science.
2. Philosophy of Mind/Cognitive Philosophy - Would provide the theoretical framework to explore how we conceptualize causation and systems.
3. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a cognitive emphasis - Particularly relevant given your interest in applying these concepts to enterprise technology.
4. Science and Technology Studies (STS) - This field examines how social, cultural, and historical contexts shape technological systems and scientific knowledge.

The most compelling path might be Cognitive Science with a specialization in conceptual metaphor and systems thinking, as this would provide the interdisciplinary foundation to apply these concepts to product management while exploring the philosophical dimensions of causation.
