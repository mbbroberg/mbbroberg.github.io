# Philosopher – Zizek, Slavoj

He challenges my very concept of self through dialectics..

🫚

Listening to his wild thoughts. Here are observations.

- his belief in true love as described is childishly unaware of the origin of the modern construct of love. Ironically, it lacks dialectic considerations beyond “true love”
- His point on “identifying with the mask” of identity and ignoring introspection is dual edged to me. There’s so much ignorance in not knowing what drives us, yet there is a point at which we can potentially achieve more if we ignore it. Think about how motivating trauma can be.

## Wiki Overview

> Slavoj Žižek ( SLAH-voy ZHEE-zhek, Slovene: [ˈsláːʋɔj ˈʒíːʒək]; born 21 March 1949) is a Slovenian philosopher, cultural theorist and public intellectual.
>
> He is the international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London, visiting professor at New York University and a senior researcher at the University of Ljubljana's Department of Philosophy. He primarily works on continental philosophy (particularly Hegelianism, psychoanalysis and Marxism) and political theory, as well as film criticism and theology.
>
> Žižek is the most famous associate of the Ljubljana School of Psychoanalysis, a group of Slovenian academics working on German idealism, Lacanian psychoanalysis, ideology critique, and media criticism. His breakthrough work was 1989's The Sublime Object of Ideology, his first book in English, which was decisive in the introduction of the Ljubljana School's thought to English-speaking audiences. He has written over 50 books in multiple languages and speaks Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, English, German, and French. The idiosyncratic style of his public appearances, frequent magazine op-eds, and academic works, characterised by the use of obscene jokes and pop cultural examples, as well as politically incorrect provocations, have gained him fame, controversy and criticism both in and outside academia.
