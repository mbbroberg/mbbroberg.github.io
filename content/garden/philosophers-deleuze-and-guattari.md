# Philosophers – Deleuze and Guattari

Very early scratch of notes... 

## Rhizomes

I'm obsessed with this imagery and the entire concept of shifting focus from verticality and permanence implied by tree-like structures to the emerging network of relationships of [Rhizomes](/rhizomes)

## Eminence

Everything is

- Concepts themselves
- It’s plane of eminence as a metaphor for the plateau we’re on — time, culture and place
- Delivered by the conceptual personae (that gives the work context)

Transcendence vs eminence?

- rejecting the philosophy of it

_not the same as existence proceeds essence_

- but looks like the inverse though

Ontology of eminence

- univocal > one type of being (not a god vs us)
	- creation / emanation / expression can all be creating stories
- Spinoza first thinker to write this down (and killed for it)

Based on Bergson’s theory of past exists in the present

- confusing at times because we think in physical means (timeline visual) instead of as temporally (moments like now happening then)
- “an ontology that instead of reduce being to the knowable, but instead seeks to widen thought to palpate the unknowable” - todd may

Being instead of knowledge or truth …

Superstructure > Marx theory that people who think through the lens of the economic state they’re born into
^ Deleuze rejects this along with other post structuralists
