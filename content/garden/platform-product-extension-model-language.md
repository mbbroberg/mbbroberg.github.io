Every platform needs a way for others to extend its capabilities to get out of the firefight of feature requests and dissatisfied users using alternatives. The naming choice signals intent and audience:

**Developer-Focused:**

- Extensions, Plugins, Libraries, Packages, Modules
- APIs, SDKs, Frameworks, Components
- Bundles, Integrations, Connectors

**User-Focused:**

- Add-ons, Templates, Themes, Toolkits
- Macros (for power users)

The name matters because it sets expectations about who should build these and how technical they should be.

## Maturity Models Signal Trust

Platforms also need clear ways to communicate the reliability of extensions. Different approaches serve different communities:

**Technical Stages:**

- alpha → beta → GA (general availability)
- experimental → preview → stable → certified

**Support Levels:**

- core → community
- unverified → verified → production ready
- unsupported → community supported → official

## Takeaway

The combination of naming and maturity signaling determines whether your platform feels like a developer tool or a user-friendly ecosystem. Clear categorization helps people understand both what they're getting and what level of risk they're accepting.

Platforms that succeed make it obvious which extensions are safe to depend on and which are experiments worth trying. It's the best way I've seen to scale platform value without overbuilding core features.
