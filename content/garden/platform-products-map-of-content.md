# Platform Products - Map of Content

> "A digital platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product."
> — Evan Bottcher

## Why This Matters

Platform products fundamentally change how organizations build, deliver, and operate software. When done well, they:

- Reduce complexity for developers in measurable and meaningful ways, letting them focus on delivering value
- Create economies of scale for infrastructure and operations, providing a model to see B2B strategy as a value center instead of a "cost center"
- Establish an enabling constraint through consistent practices across diverse development teams, which is the actual path to accelerate innovation

When done poorly, they become shelfware, bottlenecks, or expensive distractions. The difference isn't one of technology, it's in how we approach platforms as products rather than features to push.

## Core Concepts

### Foundations: What Is a Platform

- **[A Definition of Platform Product Management](/garden/a-definition-of-platform-product-management)** - What makes a platform a product and why that distinction matters
- **[Platforms as Internal Products](/garden/platforms-as-internal-products)** - Treating platforms as products for internal teams to reduce cognitive load
- **[Platform Product Extension Model Language](/garden/platform-product-extension-model-language)** - How platforms enable extension through careful design of interfaces and naming

### Team Structures: How We Work Differently

- **[Team Topologies Updated Its Concept of Platforms](/garden/team-topologies-updated-its-concept-of-platforms)** - Evolution of platform thinking in organizational design
- **[Four Team Types for Modern Software Development](/garden/four-team-types-for-modern-software-development)** - How platform teams fit into the broader organizational structure
- **[Understanding Cognitive Load in Team Design](/garden/understanding-cognitive-load-in-team-design)** - Why cognitive load is central to effective platform design

### Strategic Perspectives: Leading Platform Organizations

- **[Team Topologies: Map of Content](/garden/team-topologies-map-of-content/)** - The broader organizational context for platforms

## My Experience

My journey with platform products spans multiple roles and organizations:

- At Target: Led a data-driven pivot from a ServiceNow-based "single pane of glass" to a unified internal developer platform (TAP). The platform scaled to 95%+ developer adoption across 1,200+ engineers and introduced "developer capacity unlocked" as a transformative metric for platform value.
- At Red Hat: Applied platform thinking to digital communities, repositioning them from content sites to growth engines by focusing on high-intent topics and connecting community behavior to business outcomes.
- At Intel & Others: Designing plugin ecosystems that grew to 100s of plugins and focused on key enterprise users.

## Platform Product Dimensions

Every platform product exists along several dimensions that determine its success:

### 1. Adoption Strategy

- **Optionality vs. Standardization** - Where to enforce standards vs. allow flexibility
- **Self-service vs. White-glove** - How much assistance users need to get value
- **Piloted vs. Mandated** - How the platform gains traction in the organization

### 2. Interface Design

- **Developer Experience** - The UX and CUJs (critical user journeys) of primary users
- **API Surface** - How many interaction types are offered by the platform
- **Extensibility Models** - How the platform enables customization and extension

### 3. Value Measurement

- **Time to Value** - How quickly teams can deliver because of platform capabilities
- **Cognitive Load** - How much complexity the platform abstracts away and absorbs
- **Developer Capacity Unlocked** - Total time saved in efficiency terms across all users

### 4. Organizational Integration

- **Team Topology** - How platform teams are organized and interact with others
- **Funding Models** - How platform development is funded and prioritized
- **Feedback Loops** - How stakeholder and user needs flow back to platform development

## Common Challenges

Based on my experience and observations, these are the most common challenges platform teams face:

1. **The "Build It and They Will Come" Fallacy** - Focusing on technical excellence without validating user needs
2. **The Ivory Tower Problem** - Becoming disconnected from the day-to-day reality of users
3. **The Customization Trap** - Trying to solve everyone's specific problems rather than common needs with extensible alternatives
4. **The Metrics Mismatch** - Measuring success by platform usage rather than enabled outcomes
5. **The Funding Dilemma** - Communicating value effectively so ongoing investment is secured in a model where value is diffuse and indirect

## Future Directions

I see platform product thinking is beyond org boundaries:

1. **AI-Augmented Workflows** - Integration of generative AI to simplify complex workflows
2. **Platform Ecosystems** - Platforms that enable third-party extensions and integrations
3. **Value Stream Integration** - Platforms that optimize entire value streams across organizational boundaries, not just developer workflows
4. **Platform as Policy in Practice** - What the platform enables is the right way to work, reducing overhead of complex auditing teams that slow down effective work
