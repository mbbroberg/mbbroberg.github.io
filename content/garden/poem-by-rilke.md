You see, I want a lot.
Perhaps I want everything:
The darkness that comes with every infinite fall 
And the shivering blaze of every step up.
So many live on and want nothing 
And are raised to the rank of prince
By the slippery ease of their light judgments

But what you love to see are faces
That do work and feel thirst...

You have not grown old, And it is not too late to dive
Into your increasing depths where life
Calmly gives out its own secret.

- Rainer Maria Rilke
