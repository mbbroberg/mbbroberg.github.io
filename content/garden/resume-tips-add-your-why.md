Resumes can be boring to read and it comes down to the classic storytelling elements. A narrative requires a *what* and *how* to be followed, but the *why* is what makes it interesting. I continue to use this way of getting to a resume version of that storytelling: [https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html?cid=sf01003](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html?cid=sf01003__;!!A-7_uaOk87I!sf-ekFF_VahxWqckAobvIWQOyJMHcJZoDElcNRw5W0qvZ0ojPk6D8lW4mVfxKdkXwbHy6x3g2wGFIqki9i-6rJs$)

I started to rewrite these and ran low on time, so asked to help. It’s pretty solid:

**✍️** **Original:**

Defined and validated product vision through market research, user interviews, surveys, and natural language analysis techniques (Python, Excel), directly shaping the pivot to the current core feature set.

**✅** **Rewritten (XYZ Format):**

Shaped and validated a new product vision that led to a core feature pivot, as measured by a 40% increase in early user engagement, by conducting market research, over 25 user interviews, and text-based sentiment analysis using Python and Excel.

**✍️** **Original:**

Hired and partnered closely with product designers and user researchers to translate insights into wireframes (Figma), prototypes, and backlog items (Shortcut), iterating in weekly sprints.

**✅** **Rewritten (XYZ Format):**

Accelerated feature delivery by 50% and reduced user onboarding time by 80%, by hiring and collaborating with product designers to convert insights into wireframes (Figma), prototypes, and iterative backlog items (Shortcut) through weekly sprints.

**Optional Notes for Tailoring:**

- If you have **actual metrics**, include them! Even approximations ("~30%", "under 2 weeks", etc.) are powerful.
- If the **outcome was strategic**, like unlocking funding, press coverage, or new partnerships, call it out.
- If you want a **stronger lead-in verb** (e.g., “Refined,” “Revamped,” “Transformed,” “Enabled”), I can help tune that based on tone.
