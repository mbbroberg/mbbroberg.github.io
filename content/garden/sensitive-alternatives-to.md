The negative connotation often masks an under appreciated talent.

The negative framing includes:

- sensitive child/person to shame or imply weakness
- sensitive pallet to shame disinterest or acuteness of sensation

# When Does it Turn into a Talent?

- We don’t say a chef has a sensitive pallet— we say refined tastes or mature
- We don’t say a musician has a sensitive ear—we say perfect pitch

Better alternatives:

- Attuned
- Alert
- Empathetic
- Intuitive
- Expressive

Better descriptors for the negative:

- Cautious
- Fearful
- In need
- Reactive
- Responsive

Sensitive is not a word of much clarity in comparison to any of these.
