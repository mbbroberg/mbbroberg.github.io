> "Every part of the software system needs to be owned by exactly one team."

This simple rule from Team Topologies encodes a profound principle about boundaries in complex systems: clear ownership eliminates the coordination overhead that destroys flow.

Michael Nygard's insight applies to both code and teams:

Domain-Driven Design gives us ***bounded contexts*** for software. Team Topologies adds the human dimension: how do we *organize people to maintain these boundaries* effectively over time?

The mental model shift: **team boundaries are architectural decisions**. When you split or merge teams, you're refactoring your organization's ability to evolve the system.

> "The architecture of the system and the architecture of the organization are at odds, the architecture of the organization wins."

This means every organizational change is also a technical decision. Every technical decision implies an organizational structure.

The goal isn't perfect boundariesâ€”those don't exist. The goal is boundaries that enable autonomous value delivery while minimizing coordination costs. My theory is that these shifts are most needed at times to enforce a common definition of value.

Most organizations optimize for resource efficiency. Team Topologies optimizes for flow efficiency. The difference shows up in your system architecture whether you planned it or not.
