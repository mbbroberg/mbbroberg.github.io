# Understanding Cognitive Load in Team Design

> "Do you feel like you're effective and able to respond in a timely fashion to the work you are asked to do?"

This deceptively simple question from Team Topologies cuts through all the productivity theater straight to what actually matters: cognitive load.

John Sweller's three types of cognitive load reveal why it matters and why talented teams can still struggle with their domain:

- **Intrinsic**: the fundamental complexity of the problem
- **Extraneous**: overhead from tools, processes, environment  
- **Germane**: the mental effort needed for learning and high performance

Even the best engineers get context-switched into ineffectiveness. The insight that kills traditional resource allocation: **"A team responsible for a complex domain should not have any more domains assigned to them—not even a simple one."** 

Allocating team members by percentages across projects isn't optimization—it's cognitive load multiplication without knowing the equation. The context switching cost is invisible but devastating.
