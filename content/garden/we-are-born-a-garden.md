---# we are born a garden

Inspired by Nietzsche podcast 92

We are a unique plot of land. Shape. Location. Weather patterns that follow. But still a garden; Primed for growth.

Growths Is our very nature. But what do we grow?

Maybe some seeds came pre-planted maybe not. What’s more telling overtime is the garden patches adjacent to us: What’s in them?

Day by day, we grow what lands on our little patch of earth. If we’re lucky, The seeds that germinate are right for us. For many we get to the place where we are us and we don’t like what we see invasive weeds are wedged into every crevice. But now we’re us so we start gardening.

The start of my garden
