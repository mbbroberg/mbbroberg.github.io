**I love podcasts.** They are a perfect combination of intimacy and openness between host, guest, and audience. 

I'm interested in joining an established show as a guest or co-host. Please [reach out](mailto:matthewbbroberg+io@gmail.com) if collaborating would make sense for us both.

## Hosted

I co-launched a podcast for the Linux Foundation [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community/), focused on open source community metrics. We call it [**the CHAOSScast**](https://podcast.chaoss.community/) and I now occasionally join as a guest panelist. My favorites include: 

- [In Defense of Vanity Metrics](https://podcast.chaoss.community/9)
- [DevRel Metrics with Mary Thengvall](https://podcast.chaoss.community/18)

I co-created [The Geek Whisperers](https://geek-whisperers.com) in 2013 and co-host and edited it for four wonderful years. We originally set out to talk to Marketers about how to connect more authentically with IT professionals, but we ended up finding Sysadmins who wanted to develop other marketable skills to grow in their career. So we pivoted, interviewing incredible guests about their nonlinear career paths.

Here are a few favorites from the last season:

- [Models of contribution throughout your career (Episode 125)](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/11/models-of-contribution-throughout-your-career-episode-125/)
- [Online and offline community at Matt's wedding (Episode 116)](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/07/online-and-offline-community-at-matts-wedding-episode-116/)
- [Investing in career insurance (Episode 110)](http://geek-whisperers.com/2016/04/investing-in-career-insurance-vmware-user-group-recap-episode-110/)
