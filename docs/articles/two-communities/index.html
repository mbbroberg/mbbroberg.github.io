        <h1>What Two Communities Taught Me About My Expectations for Community</h1>
      
      <blockquote>
<p><em>A note: This post was created on a previous domain and migrated in 2018</em>{: style=&ldquo;color:gray; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;&rdquo;}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When discussing personal brand as it affects career growth, the choice of where to contribute online can be the difference between a job offer and being overshadowed by another applicant.</p>
<p>Partly due to this observation and somewhat out of an urge to understand new communities, I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself to contribute to a broader set of sites.</p>
<p><em>The results have been mixed</em>, to put it nicely. They&rsquo;ve also taught me a little about my own expectations for communities I join.</p>
<h2 id="new-redditor-ama">New Redditor, AMA</h2>
<p>{:refdef: style=&ldquo;text-align: center;&rdquo;}
![The Crest of Reddit]({{ site.baseimg }}/assets/posts/reddit-crest.jpeg)
{: refdef}</p>
<p>Reddit, with its well-deserved title as the front door of the internet, is a place of a lure, lore, and some real business value. The last part takes serious focus to notice.</p>
<p>I had a moment of appreciation when a friend of mine said to jump into a thread to discuss server-side caching while I worked at Infinio. Reddit was barely on my radar, but the referral was all I needed to jump in. The other user and I discussed the use cases, and he ultimately became a sales lead for the company.</p>
<p>That experience was the ah-ha moment: maybe there is value to gain from building the same sort of balanced personality on Reddit that I recommend on Twitter. So I jumped in further and just kept falling.</p>
<p>It turns out the subtle humor that makes Twitter so comfortable didn&rsquo;t translate directly into the threads I jumped into on Reddit. Maybe it&rsquo;s because Twitter is a tighter group of technical colleagues while Reddit is a more anonymous diaspora of members.</p>
<p>More likely, I have no idea why just yet. The difference was noticeable though: I was not a Redditor.</p>
<h2 id="check-the-box-on-stackoverflow">Check the box on StackOverflow</h2>
<p>StackOverflow is a treasure trove of coder Q&amp;A. My interest in it comes out of the energy given to its sister site, [SuperUser.com][https://superuser.com]. I&rsquo;ve been on there for many years, following a curiosity for OS X issues back in the day. I&rsquo;m also a fan of Jeff Atwood, co-founder of the collection of sites known as [StackExchange][https://stackexchange.com], ever since [I came across his love for Wumpus][https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/].</p>
<p>So I jumped in. SuperUser is a friendly community I&rsquo;ve been part of for years, so this shouldn&rsquo;t be too bad, right?</p>
<p>Wrong, of course.</p>
<p>Any of my attempts to follow similar Q&amp;A tactics across sites got overwhelmingly downvoted or just ignored. I was doing something incredibly wrong, yet again.</p>
<p>What I found more quickly here than I did on Reddit is the answer: people expect much more certainty in their responses before casting a potential solution. If it doesn&rsquo;t seem like you did your research or if you did not explore the question to a sufficiently technical root cause, you&rsquo;ll see negative numbers in a hurry.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-from-the-experiment">Lessons From The Experiment</h2>
<p>My first impression of each of these platforms brings me back to Jeff Atwood. As he says in his bio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Computers are fascinating machines, but they&rsquo;re mostly a reflection of the people using them.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reddit it tough for me to summarize. The more I participate, the more I see it as a collection of tribes, each with their own subculture.</p>
<p>StackOverflow is, in a word, dedicated. You impress no one with fly-by-night answers. Your reputation isn&rsquo;t even portable from other platforms.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-as-a-community-builder">What I Learned as a Community Builder</h2>
<p>While gamification will always be fun to me, I&rsquo;m not participating on these sites for the points. What I&rsquo;ve found from exploring these and dozens of niche communities is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>In most places, you have to <strong>be ready to make mistakes</strong> in order to participate. This risk is a substantial commitment for newcomers. The more I look at it, the more I see how Community Managers and Advocates are employed to lower that barrier to entry for others to find their voice.</li>
<li>Most of my assumptions when making educated comparisons between community cultures has been dead wrong. The inability to assume correlations between niche communities reconfirms my belief that <strong>you have to be a member of a community to be an influencer</strong>. It also reassures me that any marketers convinced the difference between sysadmins, &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; and developers are purely software-driven is wildly mistaken.</li>
<li>The only universal truth I seem to find is summed up well by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njpGH_IHjFg">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly in the following video</a>: we all must <strong>create more value than we capture.</strong></li>
</ol>
