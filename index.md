## Hey üëã. I'm Matt.
I love working with technology communities to develop products and content to inspire open source adoption.

### Communities I've Helped Build:

* **[Opensource.com](https://opensource.com)** as a Technical Advocate and Editor.
* **[The Basho Community](https://github.com/basho-labs/the-basho-community)** as the community leader and a maintainer.
* **[DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun)** as a maintainer, designing the rebrand, and creating the website.
* **[The EMC Elect](https://community.emc.com/community/connect/dell_emc_elect)** (EOL 2017) as program lead, designing the business plan, brand, and community engagement.
* **[The Sensu Community](https://sensu.io/community)** leading community initiatives from maintainer practices to user summits.
* **[Snap: the open telemetry framework](https://snap-telemetry.io)** designing the brand, documentation, maintainer and contributor strategy.
* **[Commitmas: learning GitHub socially](https://github.com/commitmas)** to collaborative learn Git and GitHub with the [vBrownBag](https://vbrownbag.com/) community.
* **[The Geek Whisperers podcast](https://geek-whisperers.com/)** as a co-creator and co-host.

### Projects I've Contributed to:

I often open small PRs as I work through new problem or as a way of saying thank you to a project. That's led to contributions to [iPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth), [Slack API Tutorial](https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial/pull/2), [Go GitHub library](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/323), [Slack Go library](https://github.com/nlopes/slack/pull/170), [Leeroy from Docker](https://github.com/docker/leeroy/pull/40), [Awesome Maintainers](https://github.com/nayafia/awesome-maintainers), [The Lita project](https://github.com/litaio/lita.io/pull/11), [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1281), [CHAOSS project](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/3) and even the [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/pull/759) because I ‚ù§Ô∏è them.
