I've been thinking a lot about my learning path as a product leader. I've been in the technology industry for over 15 years now, but rarely had the title of the job I now love. What I have learned is that the title of the job won't matter as much as the skills I choose to learn, and when I look back at my career, I have always thought like a product person.

I have been asked often enough to share my learning path, so I've put together that list here. I  hope it helps you as you think about your own learning path and as you find your own style.

## Educational Resources

Specific to landing a product job:

- [Lewis C. Lin's 2 Week Product Management Interview Preparation Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C56pX1Ilw6ZrqbN-33aPu2ezRCN5Q2yNzd1BvZqkhK4/edit#gid=0) helped me fine-tune my product thinking along with the books he lists in there (especially https://www.lewis-lin.com/decode-and-conquer)

For books, I consider the following great foundational knowledge:

- [Lean startup](https://theleanstartup.com/book)  is the most principled "method" I've found and [Lean analytics](<[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089XB8T3H?plink=Suy5zM6YOx4Zlzdp&ref=adblp13nvvxx_0_4_ti](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089XB8T3H?plink=Suy5zM6YOx4Zlzdp&ref=adblp13nvvxx_0_4_ti)>) for deep dive on metrics
- [Lean customer development](<[https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Customer-Development-Building-Customers/dp/B08VL4XRBY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lean+customer+development&qid=1613761407&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Customer-Development-Building-Customers/dp/B08VL4XRBY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lean+customer+development&qid=1613761407&sr=8-1)>) for essentials of talking to customers to validate product ideas
- [Inspired](https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/) then Empowered if you're a people leader (by the creator of SVPG)

Advanced (and last I knew a core practice at Microsoft):

- [The Customer-Driven Playbook](<[https://www.amazon.com/Customer-Driven-Playbook-Converting-Customer-Successful/dp/149198127X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FRDWBJ4AACT2&dchild=1&keywords=customer+driven+playbook&qid=1613761523&sprefix=customer+driven+pl%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Customer-Driven-Playbook-Converting-Customer-Successful/dp/149198127X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FRDWBJ4AACT2&dchild=1&keywords=customer+driven+playbook&qid=1613761523&sprefix=customer+driven+pl%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1)>): Converting Customer Feedback into Successful Products

I also like this book from Google, it’s an alternative perspective on the design process with a lot of helpful ideas: 

- [Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/ref=pd_sbs_18?pd_rd_w=mVlj1&pf_rd_p=409c42e8-023e-4951-9f77-4c63073a4537&pf_rd_r=SYJMCKSKSBVHQCYKGMBA&pd_rd_r=48515b8e-4b0e-4b72-bc2e-898980e08f87&pd_rd_wg=KNsKV&pd_rd_i=150112174X&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/ref=pd_sbs_18?pd_rd_w=mVlj1&pf_rd_p=409c42e8-023e-4951-9f77-4c63073a4537&pf_rd_r=SYJMCKSKSBVHQCYKGMBA&pd_rd_r=48515b8e-4b0e-4b72-bc2e-898980e08f87&pd_rd_wg=KNsKV&pd_rd_i=150112174X&psc=1))

## Continuous Learning

The people who inspire me:

- [Melissa Perri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissajeanperri/) - [her podcast](https://produxlabs.com/product-thinking) is my absolute favorite resource, especially when she answers questions in a "Dear Melissa" session
- [John Cutler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpcutler/) - his [Beautiful Mess](https://cutlefish.substack.com/) newsletter helped me see myself as a fellow deep thinker product leader (and I subscribe via [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) so I can read at my own pace)
- [Shreya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasdoshi/) - I love his principled approach and thoughtful summaries. He's inspired me to be clearer in my communication (he calls it "product editing")
- Lenny Rachitsky - also has a popular newsletter but I like [his podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com) the most

And the most influential organization worth a read:

- [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com) has a lot of great content from the 2010s that are becoming more common today.

Essential history that filled in a big gap for me:

- [The Collision of Product Management and Product Ownership](https://productcoalition.com/the-collide-of-product-management-and-product-ownership-439105363028)

Digging deeper -- this has an infinite amount of stuff to learn:

## Systems of Thought

My style of product is especially observant of systems and the mental models that mold around us. My top reads for that include: 

- The combo of [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com) and [Wardley Maps](https://www.wardleymaps.com) feel like a super power. When others feel stuck as they speak past each other, I draw pictures and get to clearer answers.

- Core concepts from [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557) to [Making Work Visible](https://itrevolution.com/product/making-work-visible/)

- [Wiring the Winning Organization](https://itrevolution.com/books/) and [Flow Engineering](https://itrevolution.com/product/flow-engineering/) are recent favorites that challenged while clarifying something as simple as the definition of "simplification" or "value"

- Both are inspired by politics but essential for understanding: 
    - [Nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)) taught me the phrase "choice architecture" 
    - [Don't Think of an Elephant](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Think-Elephant-Debate-Progressives/dp/1931498717) summarizes brilliant research on cognitive frames

## That's plenty 

It's a lot to take in. I hope you find something useful amongst the suggestions, but–most importantly–believe in your own style. I'd love to hear what ends up inspiring you.
