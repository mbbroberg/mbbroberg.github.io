There are topics that span industry and audience that I spend time researching, questioning, and internalizing what I can. Instead of storing this away in a personal folder, I'm sharing these raw ideas here.

# Remote work

*This research spans December 2014 to March 2020.*

I am an advocate for remote work, and the empowerment, flexibility, and communication it requires to be effective. I'm also not shy about it being more challenging for many people and organizations. Here are my favorite resources on the topic and questions I have yet to answer on the subject.

# Diversity and Inclusion 

No amount of research can make me understand the experience of being underrepresented in the technology space, but that is not an excuse to stop trying. This work is inspired by [Diversity and inclusion: Stop talking and do your homework](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/diversity-and-inclusion-innovation), and I find the more I read, the more I find myself advocating for those that do not look like me, think like me, or experience the world in the same way as I do.

## Readings and takeaways

This list spans research from June 2018 to March 2020.

* https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified
  * Takeaway: We need to be explicit, and aim toward fewer, consistent requirements in order to attract gender diverse members.
* https://www.fastcompany.com/40512537/i-was-the-only-woman-in-my-company-for-two-long-years
* https://www.fastcompany.com/1841060/redefining-diversity-new-global-workforce
  * Takeaway:
    * Estimates have by 2023 “the U.S. Census Bureau projects that … “minorities” will count as the majority among Americans 18 years old and younger.”
* https://www.inc.com/greg-satell/science-says-diversity-can-make-your-team-more-productive-but-not-without-effort.html

* https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/06/04/what-its-really-like-to-be-the-only-woman-on-my-team/#3f53ab673421
  * Takeaway: The only woman on a team is a tough spot to be. Being “one of the guys” can lead to inappropriate jokes, microaggressions, and a sense of otherness.

  * Diversity improves groups
* https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/5-key-steps-to-starting-a-di-program.aspx
  * Tip #3 - keep it simple.
    * “For example, upgrading the organization's website to include photos of and testimonials from diverse employees seems like a no-brainer, but not every organization demonstrates a diverse and inclusive culture on its site—or does so with authenticity.”
    * “‘It might be better to focus on inclusion than on diversity, especially for companies that are new to this,’ Dagit said. She suggested "inclusion nudges" to individual managers and employees to help them recognize unconscious biases or to develop more tolerant ways of working.”
* https://www.cio.com/article/3262704/diversity-and-inclusion-8-best-practices-for-changing-your-culture.html
  * “4. Quotas don’t automate inclusion”
  * “7. Forget ‘fit’ and focus on helping individuals thrive”

* https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/administration/president/DiversityOffice/Definitions.htm
  * Really good definitions:
    * Diversity is the range of human differences, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical ability or attributes, religious or ethical values system, national origin, and political beliefs.
    * Inclusion is involvement and empowerment, where the inherent worth and dignity of all people are recognized. An inclusive university promotes and sustains a sense of belonging; it values and practices respect for the talents, beliefs, backgrounds, and ways of living of its members.
* https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/TribesQA2.pdf
  * “Restricted membership” community design, as we do, has the risk of harming diversity (page 35):
    * “Decreased diversity: Restrictions might prevent some people from becoming tribe members who would have been quite beneficial to the tribe. The restriction may not allow the type of diversity that could be beneficial to the tribe.”
      * Takeaway: We have very low-restriction from the beginning
* https://opensource.com/article/17/9/diversity-and-inclusion-innovation
  * Avoid fast-paced English-only discussions.. Async may be the best response to this.
  * Avoid technical jargon – [Rust is working on this](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/06/27/Increasing-Rusts-Reach.html).
  * “11. Standardize incentives and recognition”
  * “12. Design inclusive systems that protect identity” -- there’s a lot of room for improvement on this front for the site.

  * "According to many sources, at least 15% to 20% of people in the U.S. alone struggle with some type of disability. About 70% of these are disabilities such as blindness, cognitive challenges, or chronic disease, which are not visible from the outside. This group includes many talented individuals who can bring unique and valuable experiences and insights to projects and workplaces."
  * Include them.
