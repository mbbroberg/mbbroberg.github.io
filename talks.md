**I love sharing and growing as a public speaker.** Recent talks center around the human aspects of Open Source software contribution, though my favorite to date is on the data side of Community programs. Please [reach out](mailto:matthewbbroberg+io@gmail.com) if you'd like to have me as a featured speaker. My [speaker biography is here](#speaker-profile).

## All Things Open

The metrics behind Community and DevRel programs continues to be a curiosity of mine. Our field has seemed to define the internal improvement mentrics quite effectively, yet struggles to provide external business value to those who aren't deep "in it."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All models are wrong - ask these questions. <a href="https://twitter.com/mbbroberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mbbroberg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllThingsOpen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AllThingsOpen</a> <a href="https://t.co/cGky0er8HK">pic.twitter.com/cGky0er8HK</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Mackanic (@mackanic) <a href="https://twitter.com/mackanic/status/1183775730666278917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I'm proudest of the use of an analogy: that our use of data is similar to behaviorist psychology, which can provide incentive but has no explanation for human experience. An effective metric is like Gestalt psychology, where the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

## VTUG

I had the honor of keynoting the final Virtualization Technology User Group, which was the first community event I ever volunteered at. I was given the "tough love" spot where I was asked to make people think about what they need to learn to build there careers beyond virtualization. From the feedback received, I succeeded with **Cloud, DevOps, Coding, and other Sysadmin fads**.

## REdeploy

The incredible duo of [Mary Thengvall](https://twitter.com/mary_grace) and [J. Paul Reed](https://twitter.com/jpaulreed) put together the first conference dedicated to Resilience Engineering. It was an honor to share a story of our resilient community at Sensu and to speak on personal resiliency as learned by some recent events. Sign up at [the event website](https://re-deploy.io/) to hear about future shows. Huge thanks to [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron) for her live annotation of the talk.

## Monitorama

I had the spontaneous and incredible opportunity to present a lightning talk at [Monitorama 2018](http://monitorama.com/2018/pdx.html) in Portland, OR. The title of this one is **Recruiting Open Source Contributors: a lesson from Benjamin Franklin** because of my love for the psychological phenomenon that is the [Benjamin Franklin Effect](https://www.businessinsider.com/ben-franklin-effect-2016-12). In it I hit home the power of asking for help along with some of the ways GitHub makes asking easier to do.

## Open Source 101

In "Don't Go It Alone: Recruiting Contributors," I give a 40 minute bootcamp in GitHub practices that lead to contribution to open source projects. This show was particularly fun since it hit the cross section of professionals and college students learning open source. It also gave me an opportunity to share the tactics, technological and psychological, to make recruiting contribution easier for everyone involved. Keep an eye on [Open Source 101](http://opensource101.com/) - it's a great way to give back to our community.

## Community Leadership Summit

Keynoting at [Community Leadership Summit](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/) was truly a joy. I've had this story of how Community's value is less obvious compared to other departments for some time, and this event gave me the opportunity to express it to an audience that needs to hear it. Understanding the way each of us choose to position our community's value through metrics is the difference between a well-funded program and an inevitable reorg. One of my favorite points, on baselining the value of stickers as compared to paid advertisements, was caught in this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ROI on stickers. TLDR stickers good. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CLS17?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CLS17</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mbbroberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mbbroberg</a> <a href="https://t.co/XLDXkHKsJh">pic.twitter.com/XLDXkHKsJh</a></p>&mdash; Katie McLaughlin ✨ (@glasnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt/status/860879347556679680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

## Boston VMware User Group (VMUG)
This keynote answered the question "what do you get when you cross career advice with buzzword bingo?" I went back to my old haunts of Boston to share a story of terminology, evolution of technology, and to make a plea for people to embrace open source to future proof their careers.
